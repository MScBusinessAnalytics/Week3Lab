Host was very helpful, quick communication + kindly provided us with a fan.  Enjoyed our stay and would recommend."

27425883,355242699,03/12/2018,7738609,André,"Guests can expect a great hospitality. The studio neighborhood's are very quiet, and the studio itself offer a very comfortable stay. If I come back to London and if the studio is available, it will be my first choice. Very clean and cosy. Definitely recommend it! :)"

6197340,331380996,02/10/2018,25136268,Reena,"We have mixed feelings about our stay here. First of all, Andrew was lovely and great to communicate with. The apartment is beautiful and just as described - great location, artwork on the walls, very trendy and clean. 

However, we felt like we were renting the space only, and were not really welcome to make ourselves at home. There was only 1/4 of a toilet paper roll left, and no towels that were clearly for us (Andrew lives in the apartment so all his things are in the closets - we used towels that we found in the cupboard with his belongings, but it felt a bit like we were doing something wrong...). There was no hand soap in the main bedroom bathroom, and no bags in the garbage bins in the rooms. 

I think it would’ve been helpful if there was a bit more attention to provide basics (toilet paper, dish soap, leaving out towels, etc) and perhaps leave a few notes about the apartment itself - i.e. there was a great projector system, but it wasn’t straightforward to set up, and we weren’t sure if we were “allowed” use it. Some little things would really help guests feel more comfortable in the space."

29978294,367602234,05/01/2019,224122779,Maria Giulia,"Dalle foto la casa sembrava molto accogliente ma quando siamo arrivati abbiamo trovato sporcizia, nel frigorifero c era del cibo quasi andato a male e faceva cattivo odore, le stoviglie sporche, i bagni facevano schifo, c'erano peli e capelli, nelle camere da letto le lenzuola erano macchiate, c'erano panni stesi per la casa, non andava la luce in cucina, non Andavano i riscaldamenti e nemmeno l'acqua calda. Abbiamo dovuto comprare molte cose con i nostri soldi.
Abbiamo provato a cambiare casa il 31 ma non ci siamo riusciti però abbiamo ottenuto un rimborso parziale anche se poco. Questo significa prendere in giro le persone. Maria Giulia.
Vi consiglio con il cuore di non andare in questa casa."

12288022,596551306,23/01/2020,318932703,Vivien,"The place is wonderful, nicely furnished and kept very clean by professionals. Basic household stuff are ready, so no worries if forget aomething. It is located very close to Paddington station where it's convenient to get to almost anywhere in London. Plus the quite surrounding and the park within walk distance, I couldn't expect more about the location. Oxana was very hospital and nice. We kept in touch throughout the stay. All in all, very recommended!"

40777768,664832562,16/09/2020,362762864,Manon,"They are the nicest people ever. The room is just like the picture, large and beautiful, clean, with a LOT of sunlight coming in all day. The built-in wardrobe is massive. The bed is very comfortable. Golders green is a great location if you come from Stansted or Luton with direct buses. The place is quiet and peaceful, you need to respect that. They have been the nicest people with me, always very responsive and convenient. I very much doubt you could find a better room for this price in London. Highly recommend!"

I felt like a part of the family while I was there. The location is great, the train and underground are nearby, but you can also walk to central London if preffered."

17806538,156077471,29/05/2017,2104039,Cristiane,"It's beyond my understanding how this place had so many positive reviews.
I stayed there with my 70 yo father and my stepmother.
Firstly, the lift was broken, which meant we had to carry our heavy luggage for a total of 6 flights of stairs! Fair enough that this is not the owner's fault; however, the least Toby could do was to offer some help with the bags.
Secondly, the dirt was appalling: the bedroom cupboard shelves were absolutely filthy with dust; the kitchenette floor was sticky;  the furniture was old and tired; the sofas were stained; the mattress cover for the sofa-bed had a blood stain!
Also, we arrived in London on a particularly warm week, and there were no fans available in the flat.
Finally, there were no instructions upon check-in about how the water heating system worked - although there was a ""users manual"" for the flat which included the guests' duties as well as some complex instructions about the heating system. I found it ironic that so many things were expected of us, and yet nothing was offered in return from the host. Our first showers were with cold water, until I've managed to understand and sort out the water heating. However, the shower only trickled a tiny bit of water anyway, which made it really challenging to wash our heads - we had to basically stand on were the bath tap was, with our backs touching the wall.
I have messaged Toby several times during our stay to complain about all the above issues and also to ask for help with carrying my father and stepmother's luggage down when they left; unfortunately, he said there was nothing he could do!
Summarising, I would recommend to stay away from this place, unless you're fit, young and don't really mind dirt or not having a shower!
The only positive thing about the place is the location - which is probably why he can get away with charging £141 per night!"

We would definitely stay here again in the future, thank you so much!"

Perfectly fitted our needs, as we had something planned at Alexandra Palace for the day after our stay, which was only 5/10 minutes walk away. Great location and great hospitality, would recommend. Privacy also respected."
24322841,322136660,12/09/2018,196169406,Neil,"A very nice place to stay! Josie keeps the kitchen door closed so when you entre the property the bedroom is on your right as you walk in and with the kitchen door always closed, it gives you a private entrance. The room is on the ground floor, street facing but quite as its a side street. There is tea and coffee, biscuits and even crisps and a bar fridge. The bed was huge and comfortable and clean.  The bathroom was spotless and so was the kitchen so all in all, Josie's place gets 2 thumbs up from me and i highly recommend."

For me as a smoker, I had to follow the strict rules of Anne not to smoke in the room and the house at all, but I enjoyed the garden in front of the room.
I especially wanna mention Annes outstanding hospitality.
All was good!"

3989001,204029067,16/10/2017,37564393,Mattia,"Marcia's apartment is perfect for a short stay in Hammersmith area, literally 15/20 mins with public transport to the city center. The apartment itself was nice and cozy, might be a little too small for tall people (me and my wife are both over 170cm and the bed was kinda short and small). The area itself is very nice and quiet, ideal for a walk around if you're feeling it."

1840605,18127821,22/08/2014,17867771,Jim,"GREAT LOCATION AND HOST!  Our family stayed at Alessandro's flat from August 16-21st.  It was a great alternative for a family of four (with adult children aged 17 and 20) and considerably less expensive than two London hotel rooms.  Almost all of the key tourist sites are within walking distance (30-45 minutes) and Victoria station, a key train and Tube stop, is a 10 minute walk away. 
We were pleasantly surprised by the bottle of wine waiting for us on arrival and a few key essentials in the cupboard.  
The only surprise was the lack of a sofa bed as advertised which is one of the reasons we selected this flat.  We made it work but it was a less than ideal arrangement for our 5'7"" daughter."
1216327,367195745,04/01/2019,167243352,Cullen,"Denise’s place is in a nice and quiet neighborhood on the far north side of London. I was looking for a quiet place to stay, and this was great for that! It was a bit far to get into the city though. 

Because Denise normally hosts long-term guests, there were a couple of things that weren’t like what I normally expect from an Airbnb. However, for a long term stay, I think Denise’s place is perfect and she is a great host! Fine for short-term stay and perfect for long-term!"

2655515,13416142,27/05/2014,5437092,Camilla,"We had a lovely stay in London and the Apartment. The location was great. Chelsea is a great neighborhood with all you need. We never waited longer that 1 minute outside the house to get a taxi.
We met Tiffany at our arrival and she welcomed us in the flat. She had some good advices where to go and what to do. Also we found plenty of flyers, info and maps  that helped us throughout our stay.
We stayed in the Apartment with 3 people and the sofa in the lounge was absolutely fine for our friend. We had all we needed. Kitchen, Bathroom and even soap and washing gel was there.
The only little negative thing I can say is that it could have been cleaner. The Apartment was very dusty. But we arrived earlier as agreed, so it was probably not enough time to clean. Also there was a lot of road noise as sloanes avenue is busy. But I guess staying in London in a great spot you have noise from the road. 
We can recommend this apartment and would definitely stay in Tiffanys apartment again.

The place is small but very nice, it fit the four of us comfortably. It is very clean and well-organized especially with the reminder notes, which helps to easy manage the place.

The location is in a very quite area few minutes walk to the train, which I used to commute to different places in London. The bus is just next the place and you can take it to London sightseeing; Oxford street, exhibitions street, and of course the parks.

I totally recommend the place and would like to stay in it in my next visit. 

Well done Susie and thanks for hosting us in your nice place."

3813907,46878752,14/09/2015,8176930,Leslie,"This is an attractive flat with lots of light by London standards and the deck on the main level is perfect if you have good weather. However, the deck off the master bedroom is not really useful because it looks directly into someone else's flat, but it does provide a lot of light to the downstairs.  This part of Islington is a bit rough at the edges but walk up the hill and you are in the very trendy section.  There is a wonderful mini cab company half a block away if you don't want to walk all the way to the tube station.  Our host was pleasant when she met us at check-in but there was a severe plumbing problem that they were still working on when we arrived.  We were not able to really use the apartment until 3 hours after the official check-in time. Afterwards we were a bit concerned about whether the bathroom had been properly cleaned and mentioned that to our host.  A few days later the host offered us a small refund for our inconvenience and she did give us refund but it was not the amount that she originally offered.  In the end we found the home attractive, but a bit too far from the Angel tube station, and too far from the better grocery stores. "
6034819,35408504,18/06/2015,34657260,Jon,They were very friendly and accommodating. Jorge and Nena were delightful hosts. They had tube maps and boss maps there and Jorge even showed me how to get around the area very well. I really enjoyed my stay with them.

The location and neighborhood were wonderful.  On the weekend, we enjoyed the market that was literally on the next block - packed with people and fun.  However, our location kept us quiet and cozy from the crowds. 

The apartment looks exactly like the photos and true to the listing it is a 5 min walk to the tube stop.  

In addition, Alex our host was there to meet us and walked us through the apartment. He offers tons of local tips for restaurants, cafes, and activities.  I cannot say enough nice things about this space. It will be our go-to location whenever we stay in London.  "

From the station you can go to too many tourist spots if you are here for tourism. I felt safe walking in the evening from the station. The room is best for a single person or couple. I wouldn’t recommend big luggage as it would be somehow difficult to get them up to the room. The room is clean. Very quiet neighborhood. Saly was very helpful with directions and when she was available she gave me a ride to the train station when it was raining. 
Overall, I recommend booking this nice room."

Check in was easy, and the flat accommodations met all of my needs, including a washing machine to do a load of laundry! The bed was very comfortable and the place was adequately clean upon my arrival. The only negatives I have were some mail in the front entryway upon arrival, a little sweeping that could have been done in the bedroom, and the slow draining bathtub and sink. Otherwise this place was clean, lovely, and well managed with responsive and accessible help by phone whenever you may need it.

I definitely recommend this location for single or double travelers looking for a comfortable home base as you go off to enjoy all that London has to offer. This location is walking distance from many bus stops (5 minutes) and a 10-15 minute walk to one of two tube stations. The surrounding area is also excellent for restaurants and pubs!"

Unfortunately (or not) we didn't get our booked apartment (this one) as there were any issues with the apartments and got instead an apartment in at Cleveland Square (same area). The apartment was absolutely clean and well furnished. Only the extra bed for the fifth person was very uncomfortable (the originally booked apartment had a sleeping couch for the fifth person). All other furniture was comfortable and nice. The biggest issue for us was, that there were only 3 blankets in the apartments. For couples this would be definitely fine but sharing a blanket with your friends isn't common. But we arranged ourselves and apart from the problems with the blanket and the extra bed we had nothing else we could complain about. We enjoyed to stay here (Cleveland Square) and would recommend this apartment to others."

The flat is very modern and clean. Long flight of stairs to get to the flat maybe a problem for some. Two bedrooms and two bathrooms was a real plus. On a street that isn't very busy so quiet in the evenings. Don't have a problem recommending as a great place to stay.

Upon confirming the booking, they will send you a message on directions in getting to their place and the directions were so precise that you definitely will not miss the house.  When we arrived at the house, Roger greeted us and showed us around the dining hall, kitchen, toilet and room.

The house is as lovely as the pictures provided.  I love the spaciousness of the toilet and every part of the house including toilet and room is well decorated.

The breakfast spread was fantastic.  

On the last day when we checked out, my hubby left his spectacles in their house, Agri drove out to the train station immediately to pass it back to us.  Thank you for that.

Though the location of the house is out from the central of london, I feel that the experience is worth it."

communication was a bit disappointing as my messages before arrival were never responded.  check-in time is 3pm and they barely made it on time.  flat had not been cleaned :( 
(they got it cleaned later that afternoon, 5pm)

lots of shady characters in the neighborhood (especially hobos in the park)."

2371649,542421377,06/10/2019,189825409,Roland P.,"First off, let me just say Lyn & Gavin are super genuine and welcoming. Their home is very nice and their hospitality exceeded my expectations. My room was the Victoria Room, the room was really clean, spacious and the bed was really comfortable. The kitchen was very spacious and clean, as well as the bathroom. Breakfast was available every morning as well as sourdough bread baked by Gavin. I got a slight cold during my stay and Lyn & Gavin both went out their way to ask how I was feeling and if I needed anything. The home is about a 5-7 minute walk to Leytonstone Station which is off the Central Line.
All in all, I loved my stay in London and would book their place again."

27914007,400936876,13/01/2019,217637757,Jorden,"great place conveniently located in central London, easily accessible by the tube. Patricia and Abuzer were very nice, helpful, and always dependable for a quick response no matter the question. 

The cafe just underneath which Abuzer will serve you himself has good food for a very fair price.

As it is centrally located you can expect to hear some noise from the street depending on the night. However, this was never an issue since after a full day around London, you come back pretty tired.

would definitely come back to the London Escape in the future, and would 100% recommend to others."

This apartment really is a 'home away from home', somewhere to retreat to after adventuring in London.

Mich put loads of really helpful things in the fridge for us, we had towels and plenty of space to do our own things and work together in the evening. And the journey to Excel is pretty straightforward, if packed! They have installed wireless network boosters in the house which is great, but we discovered that if you have a Mac, it gets easily confused by them and we had to temporarily switch one off to get the Macs to see the network - no biggie but took us a few minutes to figure out what the issue was. House was lovely and clean and welcoming - we'll be back! Thanks again. "

La casa es espectacular, increíble, acogedora, y muy cálida y familiar con todo esto, además está cerca de varias paradas de buses y metro así como de supermercados, bares y restaurantes. Si de verdad buscáis explorar Londres en poco tiempo o si es solo para unas vacaciones de relax os recomiendo a Fawn, sin duda no os arrepentiréis, de no haber sido por ella no hubiésemos disfrutado de Londres de la manera que lo hicimos.
De hecho fue la única que pudo esperarnos hasta tarde para hacer el check in, ya que nuestro avión llegaba a Londres muy tarde. Y por supuestisimo que Fawn es una chica agradable, simpática y divertida que no tendrá problemas en ayudaros con cualquier contratiempo que tengáis."

Pidimme paikasta, sillä asunto oli uusi ja miellyttävästi sisustettu, suihku toimiva ja saimme jopa valita erilaisista tyynyistä meille sopivimmat. Aamupala oli monipuolinen, ja siinäkin toiveemme otettiin hienosti huomioon.

Christiana ja Alex todella panostivat majoittamiseen, minkä vuoksi odotuksemme ylittyivät täysin. Suosittelemme lämpimästi!"

There are a few other rooms in the house, and in my three weeks here I was able to meet lots of interesting people from all over the world. The house is within reasonable walking distance (10-15 min) of a couple of train stations that can take you into London, and there are also bus stops located less than a 5 minute walk from the place.

The shared space was great for hanging out in the evenings after long days exploring the city.

Ralph made the whole experience seamless for us from start to finish, accommodating an early check-in and with one of the easiest check out processes I've experienced!

David viste os nabolaget og også hvor vi kunne finde busstoppestedet til Heathrow lufthavn, når vi skulle hjem - det ligger få hundrede meter fra huset. Beliggenheden er super i forhold til at kunne gå frem og tilbage til Twickenham stadium, hvor vi var i forbindelse med en koncert.

We talked a bit about my days and he gave various tips on where to go and his tips were great.
If you want to stay a bit away from the center (40mins), this is a great place to stay.
David is a friendly host and I'd stay 
there again."

The views from the rooftop terrace are beautiful and living on Portobello Rd is such a great experience as a tourist.  There were lots of helpful amenities in the flat, such as very nice shampoo, conditioner, body wash, hair dryer and straightener, Nespresso coffee and basic food and drinks to start the stay. Lots of flights of stairs to climb, so please know that carrying a heavy suitcase might be tiring.  However, the flat is worth it and you will love being in an iconic area of London."

I stayed for 4 weeks and everything I needed was pretty much on the doorstep. A Sainsbury's around the corner and the tube station a 5 minute walk away. The room was perfect for what I needed, the bed is huge and I had cupboard, shelf and wardrobe space. Room was located on the bottom floor along with a separate bathroom and shower room, so it was really nice having all my own facilities on one floor. Access to the washing machine and fridge space. The area is stunning and it wasn't noisy in the evenings.  Chiswick high street was a 10/15 minute walk away where you could find restaurants and other shops. Really nice Japanese and sushi bars if you like that kind of thing."

The 2nd bedroom is on small side but we managed to move cot in there so we could have the kids in one room for the last part of our stay. Was great to have an outdoor area for when the weather was nice, we had a couple of BBQ's and the kids enjoyed the paddling pool! 
Its an awesome location, behind south bank, few minutes walk to great restaurants, the London eye, The Tate modern, Big Ben, The Globe, many theatres, and waterloo station with its links to many fantastic attractions. Nearest playgrounds were about 10-15minute walk, but the walk along Thames was always entertaining for the kids. 
Damien was always available by text and if out of country his cousin was nearby for any emergencies. "

It's a 5 minute walk to the nearest tube station and literally right around the corner from the expansive outdoor markets in Notting Hill (as well as a Banksy, if you can find it!).  The master bedroom was very comfortable and while the second bedroom was pretty small, our friends who slept in there did not have any complaints.  The kitchen had everything we needed to cook our breakfasts and Sarah gave us clear, easy directions for getting in and out of the building and apartment.  It was peaceful at night and the only noise during the day was children playing outside, which I did not mind.  Overall a decent neighborhood and location if you want to explore Central London.  "

14527805,182147177,14/08/2017,118870618,Emilie,"We had the best time here! Huma is a perfect host, very helpful, friendly and she is easy to talk to. The house and the room were decorated with great taste (so many beautiful furniture!). It was spotlessly clean and comfortable. And her cats are so adorable!!
The house is definitely a place to go and you just feel right at home! In addition, the house is perfectly located, just a 5 minutes walk from two major underground lines. It will not take you long to reach the main monuments of the city. There are also supermarkets and pubs very close to the house.
Thank you so much for everything Huma! We will not hesitate to come back to you when we will return to London. It was truly a magical experience and the welcome was perfect. We highly recommend this house!"
6030103,42525855,14/08/2015,34030049,Ana,"My parents came to London this August to visit me and they stayed in John's flat. The flat had everything that they needed. It is a cosy, comfortable basement flat in a residential street, 5 min away from Finsbury Park underground station. John is very friendly and very helpful. The photos are exactly as the flat itself, so no tricks there. I would be happy booking the flat again when my parents come back. "
36112705,528597581,13/09/2019,198960998,Elizabeth,"This has been the best experience. Thomas is kind and really just a solid human. We could tell immediately he would be a great host. 

We’ve extended our stay and would love to stay even longer if we had the time. The flat is lovely and has everything we could need. 

I love Chiswick and always stay here when in London. It’s conveniently located to High Rd and all the cool places. Easy walk to the bus as well. Very close to the Thames and Marina if you enjoy rowing. 

We would highly recommend Thomas and his flat to anyone!! We’ve had the best time so far. So glad we’ve extended our stay a bit."
15707669,339301320,21/10/2018,48158757,Kylie,"Overall I will say we had a wonderful stay. 

Pros:
Cleanliness
Amenities
Location
Communication with your support team (thank goodness they are 24/7)

Cons:
Incorrect details given to find the flat. My boyfriend and I walked around for almost an hour trying to locate the flat. We finally went into a convenience store where they were able to help.
MAJOR KEY ISSUES!!!!
We first had locked ourselves inside the house as there were no proper instructions stating on how the locks work. We had to wait 45 minutes for a locksmith to get us out.
Then, when returning to the flat the door to let us into the building was locked and all keys on the key ring did not work. Thankfully, a neighbor let us in as it was very late. 
Then, when a new set of keys was sent that was guaranteed to open the door... that was over an hour wait for an Uber driver, only to have the new set of keys not work. 
We made due with what we had, but it was very inconvenient and we had places troubles on the  neighbors."
3143509,53906205,14/11/2015,17860545,Rachel,"Juan and Lilly's house was dirty and messy. It felt overcrowded as we were not aware that there was another long term tenant living there. During our stay, estate agents were showing future tenants around and the shower broke down twice. 
The bedroom itself was adequate. 
There was also nowhere to eat. The back garden was a mess, with dog poo and cigarette butts everywhere. 
As a former Airbnb Host, it was hard to believe that anyone would have guests staying in this house."

It's a large industrial basement unit inhabited by artists and musicians, and what it lacks in windows it more than makes up for in personality and off-the-wall decor. If you're looking for an authentic ""where it's at"" London adventure, and not just a standard tourist experience, look no further! Our rooms were clean and the hosts were friendly and interesting. There was also a cute cat. Overall, a great place to hang out. The apartment is right at the heart of Brixton, so plenty to see and do locally, and easy to get places. "

The room is as described on the webpage, modern, immaculately clean with access to a common washing machine and my own drying stand. Lots of morning sun. Importantly, a lot of storage space for a short stay. A quiet residential neighbourhood on the biking and walking track along the Thames with a small park opposite. Buses to Greenwich a 5-minute walk away and another 5 minutes to Deptford station to take trains into the city. My only regret is that I did not have enough time to actually chat with Fatih and Sibel. Comfy bed."

The room is a bit noisy because all the facilities have to fit into it (eg boiler and fridge) and because of some road noise, so bring some earplugs if you're a light sleeper. 
Clean sheets and a hot shower were all I needed (and it delivers!) and the free wi-fi is a great bonus "

29913238,580302651,22/12/2019,6513335,Gemma,"This place is amazing, I wish we could have stayed for longer! It is very stylish and comfortable, and the hosts were extremely helpful and friendly. Helene went above and beyond letting us drop our bags off early after a long flight, and was very responsive when we had to contact her, even leaving us some of her delicious madeleines at one point!

The house itself is stylish and well-equipped with a record player and dozens of records (particularly appreciated that you had Clor’s album!) and also a flashy projector with streaming capabilities. The bed was super comfortable, and the flat is in a great area close to lots of great shops, restaurants, and pubs.

This place is a solid 5*, but I will mention two small things: first of all, this place is certainly not for children or accident prone people as there are unguarded railings on the upper level and low concrete beams which mean you have to be quite careful! The other thing is the lack of hot water in the bathroom: there might well be a trick to it, I’m not sure, but we only got about 10 mins total of hot water in the morning for the whole day, and there was no hot water at night. I would say the water issue was a bit unfortunate, but it certainly wasn’t a dealbreaker, and I would 1000% book to stay here again despite this.

Thanks for an awesome stay, hopefully we might make it back to London to stay again some time"

I can see us booking Melinda's studio again for visting friends and family and have already recommended it to other friends who live in the area that occasionally need overflow capacity for visitors. Highly recommend.

Unfortunately we had a bit of an issue with the overall condition of the apartment at the time we checked in but once again Jak was there to make sure we were okay and was willing to help in anyway possible.

1671074,301426319,04/08/2018,86595027,Ladina,I chose this place as an accommodation during my 3-week-language stay in London. The flat is done up very nicely and comfy. It's located in an quiet area not far from the city centre. Jimi the dog is adorable and Ella and Ben were friendly. As the bed is a lofted bed I would recommend the place especially to alone travellers. :-)

The room is very spacious, clean and fully equipped. There is even a small fridge in a corner. Although situated on the street side, it’s not at street level: the room is safe, there is hardly any street noise, and it comes with a terrace. On the day of departure they could leave their luggage at the apartment, which was convenient. Mo and Alessa are very discrete, helpful and friendly. We highly recommend this room!"

Thank you Daniel!"

There is no central like this apartment, close to all the interesting spots and unique access to metro and bus. All the apartment requirements were as previously presented. Above all the tremendous sympathy of our host Phyllis who received us like no one else . I strongly recommend."

The location was incredible, very close to two tube stations. Johanna and Chris were great hosts and offered many local tips, as well as making check-in and check-out a breeze. The basement flat is the perfect size for a couple or two-three friends. The bathroom is a separate room, which is nice. We stayed during three of the hottest days of London in late June and it was still plenty cool at night without a/c. We would definitely stay here again. Thanks, Johanna! "

Place is tidy and  host has thought of everything to make it a really comfortable stay (slippers/robes. The bed is even super comfy. Would stay here again!
2518024,103424211,22/09/2016,11656456,Fabio,The home is even more beautiful than it appears in the pictures. Laura is an excellent host and made our stay simply perfect. I will definitely try to rent this home again every time I need to go in the area.
1829962,165636974,01/07/2017,131307080,Dee,"The house is an amazing space full of wonderful pieces of furniture and pieces collected from far and wide to make you intrigued at their origins. The welcome is second to none, you feel so relaxed and the breakfasts are cooked on the spot for you, nice and fresh and whatever you want. The bedroom for two is large and airy with everything you could need in it. Transport into central London is but a 5 minute walk away from the house. The house is located in a quiet tree lined street and is typical of many similar houses to be found across London, this being kept as one house is originally how it was, most are now turned into flats which is a sign of the times. Go to Carol and Graham,s , we spent 6 nights with them and loved it."
387939,19090739,06/09/2014,20101861,Nathan,"Exactly as advertised, really close to Shoreditch and the Bethnal Green tube station. Jimmy was there to greet us and was never 'in our way'. We had a nice bed and towels provided, and all the space we needed. We had our stay pretty figured out so we weren't around the house too much, but I was happy with it! "

We didn't meet Will, but Alun and Nicole was really warm and friendly. The place was squeaky clean, and comfortable made us feel right at home after a month traveling around Europe. A great stay overall!"

1410347,462799984,02/06/2019,70397182,Alana,"I stayed in Kate’s spare room for two nights whilst attending a course nearby. Very clean and cosy, room overlooked the garden and was very peaceful. Shared bathroom was spotlessly clean. I couldn’t get the TV to work in my room (but can’t say I was particularly upset about that). Very close to Boston Manor tube and a short walk to Ealing high street. Kate was a very welcoming host and even let us help ourselves to breakfast in the mornings. Would definitely stay again!"
5523025,128252381,23/01/2017,16107233,Georgia,Great location by river and Walking distance to Hampton court. Good running location. Good local food and pub options. Really well equipped and comfortable house. We even saw 2 foxes cross the garden at night! Also liked the sound of the church bells ringing the hour - truly an English village!
35181036,552248164,21/10/2019,302531101,Muhammad Altaf,Highly recommend. Super clean new place. Few minutes walk access to train and bus stations. Would like to stay here again.

All responses to email and phone calls were immediate. Beds were very comfortable and  the kitchen was great. Our first stay with Airbnb was an excellent experience."

17368864,701566120,18/10/2020,248719336,Karim,"Can’t fault the location. Really close to shoreditch station and about a 15 min walk to either old street or Liverpool Street. Easy check in/out especially in this climate where contactless is better. You check yourself in and out so that was great. Everything on your doorstep, you have prêt à manger just around the corner and Brick Lane is a couple mins walk.  A late night off license is very close by too. I chose to stay in an air bnb instead of a hotel and pay a bit more just to have more privacy, and this is perfect for that. Staying here felt as if it was my own. It has pretty much everything you’d need for a short stay and if you’re okay with small spaces than this is great. It’s perfect for a night or two in London. The bathroom is small but overall it was fine. Tv and internet was another reason I chose to stay here over a few others I saw."
36594510,536718358,27/09/2019,58799659,Roberto,"This place is super clean. The traffic can be a bit noisy, but the place and host are really nice."

494343,3376679,20/01/2013,4359146,John,"My wife, best friend, and I spent a week here in January. We couldn't recommend the place more. 

Prior to the visit, Stephane was very, very fast in getting back to us when we sent him emails with questions about the place, meeting time, and surrounding area. He was also very thorough in his replies--we never felt like we were being brushed off. When we arrived, his sister was ready and waiting for us at the flat, despite our late flight arrival. 

The flat was very easy to find, maybe a seven minute walk from the tube, which was within a half hour of most of the big London sites. The neighborhood felt really safe, and there was a store and several decent pubs immediately available--but no terrible city noise at night. 

The flat was pretty clean when we got there, had a nice bathroom, all the kitchen and washing machines were in good order. The refrigerator was not huge by any means, but adequate for a week's worth; we were also cooking at home to cut costs, so if you go out to eat a lot, I'm sure it'd be more than big enough. 

There wasn't much walking space in the bedroom, but the bed was good sized, and the closet was ok. Can't vouch for the pull-out couch, but my friend seemed to be sleeping well. The patio space was not huge, but nice in the mornings. If you were going in a warmer season, I bet it'd be really nice to sit out on and enjoy a beer on a summer evening.

If you've got more than three people, the place might be a little cramped. For two people, it'd be perfect. For three adults, it was very comfortable.

We were there during a very cold week, and felt warm enough, albeit we also turned the space-heaters on. 

Really, there was nothing to complain about. I know it must sound like I've been paid off or something, but what you're getting with this place is a cleaned up flat with a great location, especially if you're in London for the first time, and sight-seeing like we were. For the middle of a major city the price was fair, and the host was really legitimate. 

Unless you prefer staying in a really, super-cheap hostel, this has to be the best bang for your, um, pounds, in London. We would definitely stay here again if we ever go back. "
17888076,194278016,16/09/2017,64435440,Joanna,Ana and her husband are very kind and accommodating hosts. My visit was lovely. I would definitely stay there again.

A noite é um controle terrível com a entrada até mesmo dos hóspedes , quem alugou com a intenção de férias ou algo assim não é um local adequado a não ser que seu dinheiro só der para isso.mesmo , é igual a um hotel , sendo que é para estudantes, depois de tentar acordo com a anfitriã e a Airbnb e tanta luta e choro eles resolveu devolver uma porcentagem pela propaganda enganosa.. pelo menos isso , mas antes disso me chamaram  até de louca , sorte minha que não eu não fui a primeira cliente a reclamar, creio que a direção já pediu a retirada das fotos fazendo propaganda enganosa .

Die Übergabe der Schlüssel funktionierte großartig und am letzten Tag dürfte ich sogar bis nach Mittag mein Gepäck dort unterstellen. Das Zimmer ist genauso wie auf den Bildern dargestellt, alles ist sehr sauber und das Bett sehr bequem. Ich habe weder Küche noch Wohnzimmer mitbenutzt, weil ich ständig unterwegs war, aber ich hätte es jederzeit gekonnt. Das Wifi ist kostenlos und sehr schnell. Das Zimmer ist etwa eine Minute vom Bahnhof West Ham entfernt und liegt in einer ruhigen Seitenstraße. Der Bahnhof ist an drei U-Bahnlinien, DLR aund National Rail angeschlossen und ist dadurch auch bei Streckensperrungen gut erreichbar. Ich würde jederzeit wieder buchen. Vielen Dank Will and Tony!"

19174384,231918343,03/02/2018,4676007,Lila,"Tobias & Annette's place is a perfect gem- located very close to two Tube stations and convenient bus stops.  The Brackenbury WIne Rooms and Cafe, Bill's, Byron's, several excellent pubs are all very close.  
Most importantly, it's a chic, super-clean, quiet oasis in the city with every amenity you'd need.  
Tobias & Annette are also very responsive and communicative.
I will definitely stay there again - and I highly recommend it to anyone considering a London getaway!"

Flat had everything I need and is just next to a huge Sainsbury's, which is convenient. The only slight downside is that it is quite a walk from the Tube station, especially if carrying luggage but the place is easy enough to find. Would recommend!"
1602503,13927061,08/06/2014,12784976,Tiffany,"Chose this accommodation for a convenient stay near Heathrow. 
Stayed for a night, arrived in the night and left very early the next morning.
Direct bus services from Heathrow (bout' 30 mins) / Hatton Cross tube station (bout' 20 mins) and just a couple of mins walk from the bus stop to the house.
Love the quiet neighbourhood!
As Zareen was not in when i arrived, she made arrangement that i was well received at the door and her friend even walked me out to get my dinner!
I made a second visit to the house a few days later to pick up my stuff, so thankful that Zareen helped to receive and kept it. 
The best part was the chatting sessions with Zareen and family friend on both visits! 
Overall enjoyed the stay, warm yet respectful to privacy and easy communication through Airbnb messaging.
Oh! did i mentioned the comfy bed? 
Thanks Zareen (and i can't believe i forgotten to take a picture with you!) =)"

Highly recommended!"
1605623,286533730,06/07/2018,120422674,George,"Cecilia is simply the best host you could ask for. While check in was at 3 pm, I asked if I could drop off my bags earlier to explore the city without lugging the bags around, and she was completely understanding of this. Upon arrival, she gave a tour of the home, with a pre-stocked shelf in the fridge with drinks, snacks in the room, guide books, converters, toiletries and towels on hand, and just about anything you would need if you had forgotten to bring. She would say reminders to “not be shy” and to “do as if you were at home.” As someone who doesn’t like getting in people’s way, these little reminders were appreciated as she even urged to not worry about shower frequency (especially in the heat of the summer). Anything that was needed, was a “just ask” policy, although everything needed was already provided. 
The neighborhood was amazing, and closed to countless bus stops, as well as the overground Canonbury train. This made getting around to all parts of the city extremely easy. I had breakfast and drinks around the apartment a handful of times as well, and pubs and restraints were all walking distance. If I go back to London, I will absolutely stay here again!"

You’ve got cafes, restaurants, shops and a market nearby.

The apartment is so cute and stylish and perfect for a business trip as you’ve got a workplace.

Bed was comfy and the view is lovely from the bathroom and bedroom windows.

Only thing to consider is the stairs as the apartment is located on the third floor I believe.

I luckily got help with my heavy suitcase of the people I met on the check in and check out.

9641609,81093547,20/06/2016,60965584,Meg,"Fabulous choice.  The place is exactly as described, and the bed is comfortable.  It backs onto a park, so the back rooms are very quiet.  I loved the neighborhood, too -- not at all posh, but two blocks from swanky shops and restaurants.  (If you stay here, I highly recommend buses over the Tube -- the 394 stops right outside the door, and the 55 is just around the corner.  So convenient.)

Alice and Robert were extremely helpful and very easy to communicate with throughout, from before I reserved the flat until moments before I was leaving.  Once I had reserved, they sent a wonderful little handout, with all the info you could possibly need.  (Hint: Read it thoroughly, esp. the bit about rubbish.  I ended up having to do some last-minute rubbish sorting due to my own stupidity.)

Cats: One is incredibly sweet and cuddly -- but if you're not keen, she won't insist.  The other comes in occasionally to scope you out but doesn't want anything from you.

The only possible negative is that the water pressure in the shower is kind of low, even for the UK.  But there is nothing Alice & Robert can do about that.  In every other way, they've created a perfect rental, down to clearing out shelf and drawer space for you.  (Not all Airbnb hosts bother....)"

Lovely location.

Quiet location.

Take your own tea coffee and milk as it's not provided. Shower needs an update as it's barely a trickle and takes an age to heat up.

On a plus it was warm and not cold. And parking is available. Which is a massive plus in that part of town."
2354700,120005461,06/12/2016,44149196,Emma,"Tess' place was perfect for our young family of 5. We enjoyed our short walk to Queens Park station to explore London city and also the bus from Kilburn Park also 5-7 mins walk away. The flat is warm, cosy, has great mood lighting and has comfortable beds. The kitchen is spacious and modern and is well equipped with everything you need to eat in (we enjoyed picking up goods from the local M&S). We welcomed the bit of extra space and the family dining table which is bathed in sunlight in the mornings. The girls loved the courtyard garden which backs onto the train line and the occasional squirrel!  The trains aren't noisy and the girls loved watching them pass. The only downside is that due to the nature of terrace homes you can hear neighbours above you walking around but this is something that can't be controlled by Tess. We really enjoyed our time in the flat and Tess was a great host who left a beautiful home to enter into on a very cold winters day! "

40393238,655220394,23/08/2020,56957721,Daniel,"We stayed at Claire's space for 6 weeks whilst we were doing some renovations works at our flat. We know the area well, it's very quiet and Telegraph Hill upper park is an amazing location to view the city. Your nearest station is downhill, so if you don't mind climbing the hill to the flat then it's a great place to stay if you are visiting the city. The flat was quiet and clean whilst we stayed, the kitchen is very small and can get pretty steamed up and unfortunately the oven wasn't working, for short stays I feel like this wouldn't be an issue. The bedroom and living rooms were a reasonable size and the internet was fast allowing us to work from home during our stay. Claire is really quick with communication and had a cleaner come around every two weeks which was great. We had a really lovely time at the flat, and would recommend if you were visiting London."

17708659,594944005,19/01/2020,19801714,Lisa,"The apartment was clean and well equipped. Bed sheets and towels were spotless and fine. The area is very nice, it is easy to get to all sights and places by food or subway.
All in all everything was good, except of the bed. The bed is unstable and just turning around while sleeping was very rickety. Additional to that the whole building is very noisy so flushing toilets from neighbors, doors and steps were waking us up early. For someone who has a very deep sleep this might not be a big problem and the perfect accommodation.  Thank you for having us."
2511072,23780820,09/12/2014,24180875,David,An early start meant I didn't get to chat with Cait but the room was lovely and the stay quiet and restful. All was as I had hoped. Would stay again.

Check in was a bit confusing at first but makes late arrival possible. The one bad thing was actually the others staying there - I was kept awake all night by banging, running up and down stairs and shouting! As I needed a place to stay for an early flight, this was a bit of a shame. However, I appreciate that the Airbnb host cannot be completely responsible for this!"

11336658,225993045,08/01/2018,34887243,Katie,"There was nobody in the hotel when we arrived, and we let ourselves in using a door code as instructed by Denise. The room and location were great. We phoned Denise at 9.45pm as were concerned that our room had french door leading onto a small balcony which were unlocked and there was no key, and we could not get a signal for the TV. Denise was helpful, and fixed the our TV remote problem embarrassingly quickly! 
However, I am giving a bad review (the first time ever on airbnb) as we had a terrible night with virtually no sleep due to a very loud TV (or possibly radio) broadcast. It started at about 11.30pm and we assumed that it was coming from another guest room. It was so loud that we could clearly hear the words. At 3.30am it was so loud that we went out of our room to investigate - we thought someone must have fallen asleep (or died) whilst watching TV. We discovered that the broadcast was coming from behind a curtain in the “private area” of the hotel, at the bottom of the stairs. I phoned Denise at 3.35am and within seconds the programme was switched off. I don’t know what was going on. There was nobody at reception when we left at 9.15am. We expected to receive an apology and explanation at some point, but have not been given one."

He waited for me to leave in the kitchen I couldn't take a shower before I've left he was just repeating no no no check out 10am. Bad experience!!"

He gave us a detailed tour of the apartment and explained all the in-house amenities. He also briefed us and gave recommendations on attractions in the neighbourhood. 

The apartment itself is amazing. The size is great, the views are spectacular and the multiple balconies add immense charm to the place. The apartment is superbly located - very close to the tube station, a convenience store and multiple bars and restaurants."

Nick's flat had everything I needed (to cook, in the bathroom, etc) and was also pretty quiet. It was also a solid work-from-home set up for me, during the lockdown.

3513126,245445335,22/03/2018,64826696,Desiree,"If you are looking for a excellent location (close to bus, underground stations, local eateries), excellent communication (sent helpful information prior to my arrival and provided even more when I arrived), home like atmosphere (3 levels makes it feel like a house and there is plenty of room to spread out), and a place to feel at home during your stay in London then this is it! Victoria is an excellent host and her home is wonderful. This by far was the best AirBnb experience I have had to date. The pictures are accurate to the home. The wi-fi was great, with a firm bed for a amazing nights sleep, and little things one may need (international adapters, videos). I will definitely be back to London and hope to stay here again."

Auch die U-Bahn war schnell zu erreichen. Die Kommunikation, Checkin und ihr lief reibungslos. allerdings war die Unterkunft nicht ganz so sauber wie man es sich gewünscht hätte. Im Schlafzimmer war es sehr staubig und unter dem Bett war Schmutz...auch fehlte leider ein sauberes Geschirrtuch...
Das Zimmer sieht leider schon etwas ""benutzt"" aus und nicht mehr so einladend wie auf den Fotos. Die gute Lage macht allerdings einiges wett."

Cleanliness, location, and all the other stuff you look for in an AirBnB was great. Couldn't ask for more. Most of all though, the family hospitality - for me, this is home away from home. I celebrated my birthday with them. Highlight for sure! Additional perks - they are very knowable about England (and then some), great English humor, brekkie served on your schedule, WiFi, warm home, fluffy blankets to curl up in from a long day out. Restaurants, parks, grocery, bank, coffee shop, library, just a 10 minute walk away. Bus stops along the way, Underground near by. You'll be so happy you stayed here!"

The flat was quiet and relaxing with an incredibly comfortable bed. Despite being in central London and at the back of Hoxton street the nights were very quiet. The furnishings and cleanliness also made us feel very much at home for our three day stay. The flat feels very secure and it's just too easy to get around. The kitchen was very well equipped as well as ample room for dining space. The bathroom was clean and spacious with generously provided shower products. Ultimately I have no complaints, there was slight confusion on finding the key but Luke was easy to contact.  Would 100% use this air bnb whenever I next visit London. Thank you for a great stay Luke :)"

The bus stop is right in front of the house, great to visit Central London."
21529082,294514695,22/07/2018,11937074,Lara,"Gianluca's place is very clean and nicely furnished, the room I was in is very big and lovely with new furniture etc. It does get very bright in the morning which I don't mind but if someone prefers dark rooms, a different room might be better. The only drawback is the neighbourhood which, although being very central and close to nice places, can feel unsafe. There were shady figures outside the apartment almost every night being loud, Gianluca helped however he could with that - of course it is neither his responsibility nor his fault. It got a bit better as I was leaving so it might be better in future. 
Overall I had a good one month stay with Gianluca and enjoyed my time at his place."

What I think should be noted about Gerry is the trouble he is going through to help me out. As I've been traveling I have been collecting rocks for my grandma. She asked me to bring her a rock from each place I visited. Unfortunately she passed away right before I left but I still have been gathering rocks. I forgot a rock during my trip in London and after messaging Gerry about it, he offered to mail me a rock to my home in America. If for no other reason this is why you should book with Gerry! He is great & we loved our stay! "

The location is perfect - nearby to several of the vintage and weekend markets and lots of food options!  The room was exactly as pictured and I rarely encountered any of the other people staying in the flat.  On thing to note, there is a long, steep staircase leading up to the flat that was a bit tricky to navigate with luggage.  Definitely recommend this room if you are visiting for a quick trip or sightseeing!"

16350713,321372626,10/09/2018,46797225,Kate,Cara's place is convenient if you need a place to lay your head after working in the city. I didn't get to meet her but her mum was really friendly when she welcomed me. It was a little bit more of a walk to canary wharf than I expected as you need to walk all the way down the road to go back up it which was a little tiring with a big suitcase! Besides that though it was as expected.

26484622,422871793,12/03/2019,230424528,Vicki,"Elizabeth and Carl were very helpful and up front with us.  The original flat we reserved had a boiler problem that could not be fixed by the time we arrived in London.  Elizabeth and Carl contacted us right away and offered another one of their flats as an alternative.  The flat was located in Nottinghill and was about a 5 minute or so walk to the Tube station, so it was very convenient for getting around London.  The flat itself was very nice although it did have a few idiosyncrasies that made for an interesting stay.  There was a problem with the television atenna that we had to MacGyver so that we could get more than three BBC channels.  The couch was a bit low and hard to get up and out of.  The second bedroom was a bit croweded with two beds.  My traveling companion felt that neither bed in that room was very comfortable.  I stayed in the master bedroom and found the bed to be very comfortable.   We got the impression that the flat was in the process of being refurbished as there was some sort of countertop in the second bedroom as well.  The flat was in a very quiet area which was much appreciated.  All in all, we had a very nice stay.

I wish I could give Elizabeth and Carl more than the five stars allowed for their responsiveness and thoughtfulness.  They responded to our many questions quickly and went the extra step when we asked about transportation to Kings Cross Station for the next leg of our journey by reserving a car to take us there.  Elizabeth and Carl were wonderful hosts, and I would not hesitate to stay at one of their properties again in the future."

Amelia's house is very near bus stations and Fulham Broadway/Parsons Green tube stations. You may try a 60minute walk to Hyde Park. At the end of the street you have several restaurants where you can have nice breakfasts and brunches. Nice neighborhood, it felt extremely safe and organized. I highly recommend Amelia's house.

But be aware that there is road work nearby and we had been stuck in traffic for an hour. There are a couple things could be improved. The water pressure of the shower is terrible. There is very little water coming out. The drainage seems a bit blocked as well. There is only one pan in the kitchen is usable and its bottom is quite damaged. There was egg stuck on it from the previous guests.

The bathroom was next door to our room, We shared with the other guests  but was never any conflict  as toilet and shower  are separate.  Shower was amazing!

I found it professionally cleaned, and even the linen was ironed. The guest was attentive, with good communication and quick response. We used the bed and the sofa bed, and they both were comfortable. Sofa beds are not usually that comfortable, Up to four people could stay comfortably. I found everything ready in the kitchen to cook. The location is also very good. Finsbury Park station is 10 minutes walk, and bus stops are also very close, back and forth the city centre, for example King's Cross. I definitely recommend it, and if I come back again, I will go back. Thank you Joel for everything."

He has such a lovely temperament, plays sensational guitar and will make you feel incredibly welcome! 

We had the best time ever staying at his place. 

Transport is super easy as you have brixton station, a millions buses and of course our worst enemy uber! 

Best Airbnb experience EVER"

Clean and VERY comfortable, this listing lives up to the hype. The downstairs bathroom and bedroom I was told was excellent and the kitchen had everything you could need for your stay - both for cooking in or just day-to-day holiday snacking. The complimentary prosecco, milk and OJ was a nice touch.
The lounge room on the ground floor had an extremely nice position across from Clapham Common, with large windows, a very large living space and some big comfy couches making it ideal for relaxing and enjoying the view.
Finally, Charles was a great host - very easy to stay in contact and very helpful both with the introduction as well as during the time in the apartment.
I will definitely be trying to use Charles' listing again should I need to."

This isn't a hotel - so if simply tasks like starting a fire in a wood stove or running the engine a bit to heat water for a shower don't excite you, then you should stay in a hotel.  If however, your sense of adventure aligns with your sense of comfort then stay onboard Jessie.

Meg will leave you well equipped and quickly show you the couple of tasks necessary to live on the water.  Then relax in solitude.

The boat is exactly as described and I'm eager to return!"

The flat isn't big but extremely tidy , beautifully decorated and comfortable . The room is cozy, airy, and well-lit when the weather is sunny. Tom put some very useful notes in the room , especially the one that describe the usage of keys ~ . I traveled alone as a female , but felt very safe in Tom's flat .

Alle Fragen die wir im Vorfeld hatten wurden stets umgehend von Alison beantwortet. Sie ist eine sehr nette Gastgeberin und hat die Unterkunft hervorragend eingerichtet. Die Küche ist sehr gut ausgestattet und es ist alles für den täglichen Bedarf vorhanden. Die Wohnung liegt mit Blick auf einen kleinen schönen Park und ist einen ""Katzensprung"" von der Shadwell Overground bzw DLR entfernt. Im Umkreis von 200 m befinden sich kleine Shops, eine Bäckerei, Apotheke usw wo man alles bekommt um sich selbst zu versorgen. Bei unserem nächsten Trip nach London werden wir auf jeden Fall wieder in Alisons Appartement wohnen, da wir uns dort auf Anhieb wohl gefühlt haben.

12120286,169936392,14/07/2017,9448992,Mark,"This is a beautiful and well equipped apartment for a couple.  We loved the openness of the space.  The large windows provide both sunlight and a kind of privacy because of the large trees in front of the windows--we kept them open most of the time and so the apartment was bright and airy.  The kitchen is immaculate, well equipped, and even well stocked--and Polly was a very generous and considerate host in all ways.  We also love the location near Primrose Hill Park, the Chalk Farm tube stop, and even a nearby street with restaurants, stores, etc.  The Square is a dead-end and so there's very little traffic.  That said I wouldn't say it's a quiet neighborhood as there's a small neighborhood park often filled with children playing, a nose that I find perfectly congenial and if you don't, all you have to do is close the windows.   Highly recommend.  Will come back soon.

Was very helpful in getting us checked in and running us through the apt. The flat is a little unfurnished right now, but Oscar just moved in and the place will soon be a great place to stay for those looking for a flat in the awesome neighborhood of Chelsea. Right on the main drag with loads of  shops & restaurants, and a quick 15 min walk to the nearest tube station. Would highly recommend to future guests.

Nice for a quick budget stay. MiTul’s place is about an 8 minutes walk away from the train/ bus station so tourists sights are easily accessible. The walk is a little cold at first (especially when it rain) but will be fine after you’re warmed up. There is a lot of cheap and delicious Middle Eastern food by the train/bus station. MiTul gave great check in direction. I didn’t meet MiTul in person as the whole place seemed to be rented out but he communicate well. 
When I came, the curtain rod was broken and taped back together. Also note that there may be no towels provided. I assumed there would be based on the picture and ended up having to make a run to Sainsbury's in Whitechapel to get one. The heater is not easy to understand/ adjust. I was only there for one night and had warm clothes so I was ok. I’m sure if I would have asked, MiTul would have answered with kindness. 
Overall, a good stay for the price with some minor cons."

The appartment is clean, very personal (lots of drawings, music instrument,...), not luxurious but comfortable enough for 2 people. Natalia and her father were really friendly and helpful. The situation is also good (direct bus to downtown, or you can walk 15-20 minutes to get to Highbury & Islington where you have shops/bars, and the subway). The place is very calm, so you can enjoy your night without any trouble. all in all, a very good stay, I recommend it!"

Walworth High Road is nearby with all you need and it has character.  The area is so quiet too;  underground stations nearby etc. Lovely bathroom, welcoming place and value for money.

Last but not least. Barry and Jill are super nice and were quick to respond through email to our travel questions. We'd stay here again in a second."

I choose this room as she wanted to stay in a clean room which has a private bathroom, and it should be near my flat - and this room was the perfect one for her. The location is really closed to the beautiful Telegraph Hill Park, which is the best park to see the beautiful London central from the distance. 
Sophie was really kind and thoughtfully cared for my mum. She said Sophie kindly delivered morning coffees in a lovely cup at the exact time as requested and it was tasty."

I contatti sono avvenuti tramite sms oppure tramite un numero telefonico alternativo. Le chiavi erano custodite un un lochbox, una sorta di lucchetto con sportellino da aprire con una combinazione ricevuta tramite sms, agganciato ad una inferriata. Devo  però onestamente riconoscere che l'alloggio era addirittura migliore di quello che immaginavamo: ristrutturato di recente, ben arredato, ordinato, pulito, organizzato, confortevole, riscaldato autonomamente. La cucina è attrezzata e completa, adatta anche ad un soggiorno lungo. Ben collegato con autobus e metro a 100 metri. Il mercatino di Camden si trova a pochi passi ed è assolutamente da visitare sia per il cibo multietnico venduto cucinato sulle bancarelle che per acquisti caratteristici. La zona è molto frequentata ed un poco rumorosa, ma ne vale la pena. Se dovessimo far di nuovo visita a Londra certamente tornerei in questo appartamento. Grazie Angela.

The flat was in a Lebanese area, judging by the long strip of Lebanese restaurants and Halal markets nearby. However, just a stones throw away were many other restaurants and grocery stores to choose from. The apartment itself was modern and clean, but small, so best for a short stay. Upon arrival we were greeted by his cleaning woman, since Tim was traveling. Although we arrived a few min. late, she was waiting for us outside the flat. She hadn't finished cleaning, so for a few awkward minutes we stood in the flat while she completed vacuuming the floors. We had a little trouble with a blown fuse and the fridge not working, but Tim responded immediately to help us fix the issues.  Overall, we enjoyed our stay, but could have used a better introduction to the flat and it's amenities."

We were provided a fully stocked refrigerator with all kinds of breakfast foods, coffee, tea, candy, and fresh bottled water.  Bread, toaster, hot water kettle, and cereals. 
The bed was most comfortable, and the large screen TV was great.  The bathroom was large and had a great shower.  There was a large area for our luggage and clothing.  We were close to the airport & the bus was free to the airport.  We had access to the underground tube and there was plenty to do in the area.
I would highly recommend this location as it is comfortable, had great host, the area was quiet, the unit had locked access, the supplies were plentiful, free bus to the airport, and all the conveniences of home.

The room was bright and spaceous, with enough space for my clothes and personal items, and a very comfortable double bed.  The bathroom was equally spaceous and had everything I needed. Melissa was an incredibly warm and welcoming host. As I had business in Forest Hill, Melissa's home was the perfect location, since I could walk to where I needed to be. Travelling into Central London was also very easy thanks to the Overground, with good connections to the tube. Definitely recommend this wonderful AirBnB!"

She had taken us in, offering a bed and free breakfast. It's an very attractive offer.
런던에서 조용하고 한적한 시간을 보내고 싶으시다면 이 곳에 들려보세요. 호스트인 애드리스는 매우 친절하고 자상한 사람입니다. 그녀가 준비해놓는 아침식사를 통해 그녀의 자상함을 느낄 수 있죠. 2층으로 된 이 집은 깔끔하고 햇볕이 참 잘 들어요.

The house is located nearby Catford Centre, 3 Zone in London. You can go to The Bank, Greenwich and Lewisham within easy access of Catford Centre. 
But it will be a long Journey If you go to 'Hyde Park'.
이 집은 런던의 외곽(3존)인 Catford에 위치하고 있습니다. 그리니치와 뱅크 지역으로 가긴 편리하지만(Catford Centre에서 47번 버스 이용) 주요 관광지가 몰려있는 시내로 나가긴 힘들어요.

Oh! Sometimes, you can see a 'Red fox' in front of house. It's an amazing experience.
참, 가끔 집 앞 도로에 나오는 여우도 볼 수 있답니다.:D 

혹 한국분들이 이 글을 보신다면...
시내와의 거리가 멀다보니 관광보다 체류에 중점을 둔 장기여행자에게 적합한 숙소입니다. 또한 흑인 거주지역이다 보니 여자 혼자는 무리가 있을 것 같네요.(동네가 위험하진 않으나 스스로 느끼는 불안감을 고려) 동행이 있는 장기 여행일 경우 적합한 숙소가 아닐까 싶어요."

It's a 3 story apartment/home, just in case you have people that aren't able to get up and down stairs easily, but it adds to the charm. Depending on your arrival time, you will need to check in at the City Relay office, and then go to the apartment, which adds an extra cab ride...just something to plan ahead for. There is a washer and separate dryer in the unit...both worked really well (compared to an appliance that both washes and drys clothes), and there was laundry detergent so that was very convenient. Location was (Website hidden by Airbnb) a 3 minute to the Marble Arch, but on a quiet little street/alcove so it was secluded. Only noise was early (8am) on garbage pick up days, which can't be avoided, but isn't an issue if you are an early riser. Overall, great location and clean/updated home!"

4092595,494940548,25/07/2019,22145876,Linda,"Dear Gina and Andrew, 

we had a wonderful stay at your place. You are very hospitable: Andrew gave us many tips for restaurants and sightseeing with a map that we could borrow and the first day of our stay the apartment was filled with the smell of freshly baked banana cake, which we could take. The peaceful ('hidden') street and characteristic apartment are absolutely lovely and adorable, and super centrally located in London! We would definitely recommend it to everyone!"

18869754,314733342,27/08/2018,195396603,Hélène,"My staying at Judith's was very nice. The room is cosy and comfortable, you'll have a good night sleep in the bed. You will also find a mini-fridge and everyting you'll need for your staying: towels, soap, shampoo, hair dryer...
The house and especially the kitchen and bathroom are extra-clean: suitable for tidy persons!
The breakfast is tipically english and good (orange juice, tea/coffee, milk, bread, jam, cutted chease...). Judith likes to sit with you in the morning and have a talk before you leave for the day, it's a perfect way to discover your host.
The house is well-located and at less than 10 minutes-walk to the Northern line, with which you can go pretty everywhere.
Come at Judith's without hesitation!"

I book 5 days first (3/13-3/18),after I live one day, I decided to canceled the journey because of the Corona virus issue.
then I propose the canceled plan and leave the hostel (I only live one day) and came back to my country.
But I get a reject in 3/18,and never receive any hostel message.and rejected give the return back.

The hostel manager is too devious that I had ever seen.

Not any recommend at all."

Für 3 Tage waren wir bei Carole und ihrer Familie untergebracht. Es war alles genauso, wie es ausführlich beschrieben wird. Zudem haben wir die riesige Gastfreundschaft und die tollen Gespräche (trotz unserer dürftigen Englischkenntnisse) sehr zu schätzen gewusst. Das ganze Paket hat mindestens 5 Sterne verdient und ist absolut zu empfehlen. Gerne kommen wir nochmal wieder! :) Liebe Grüße Steffi & Marian"

So many restaurants and shops nearby too many choices. And Kings Cross station is right by the train station across the street so you are just a hop skip and jump away from any sites you'd like to visit in London. We used the Tube to get around, now if you have kids, 10 and under are free there is a side area at the turnstyle at each tube station that an adult scans their Oyster card and the kids walk through without having to pay. We stayed at this apartment in cold November and it was so warm and cosy inside and the bathrooms are wonderful too great water pressure. No stairs to get in so convenient and if you do arrive early for check in there is the Blue River Cafe couple doors down that will hold your luggage for cheaper than the station and you should eat there as well they have great food and lovely hot tea!! There's a Tesco grocery shop a block a way and seriously their croissants/bread/pastries are so yummy too we would stop by there in the morning to get snacks for the day out. Don't hesitate to book Debbie's place it's great! There are stairs down to the 2 bedrooms and bathrooms so if you have any physical issues that may be a problem, if not then you're good to go!!"

However, Cathy response to me super quickly. Thanks for her warmly tips for access to the home. Besides, the bedroom is quiet cozy and the location is perfect. 

Overall, it is good but not worth that price."

Jamie met us at the flat and helped us carry all of bags down. He was so helpful explaining all of the ins and outs of the apartment and made sure to check in throughout our stay to ensure everything was going smoothly. We met Shanin a couple days later and she was extremely helpful, recommending that we explore a nearby street to see some horses. The flat itself is gorgeous, everything has clearly been redone very recently. The shower especially was excellent and had a very powerful spray. The location of the flat, on a quaint little mews road right between Paddington and Hyde Park, was unparalleled and had great access to shopping and sights alike.

I met the flat in a clean condition and it had a small kitchen with everything someone would need in it. Sani was a very warm host and was there to receive us & he even provided clean supplies, material for travel around the area and complimentary breakfast items in the kitchen. There was a super fast internet with cable TV, which was really ideal for me when I returned back to the flat to unwind. The flat itself is really nice and just 10 min walk to the Black Horse station which gets you to central London in just around 10 mins. I would really recommend Sani & his flat to anyone."

Everytime you let go of a door it bangs. 
Pictures make it look a lot better than the real thing. 

I feel i was overcharged for this property considering some of the other propertys prices of high quality."

The flat was nice, bright and with everything we needed. Description and photos exactly match the flat.
Location is very good, it is in the quiet area but everything you need is near - grocery across the road and nice pub (The Island) with delicious food. The property was only a few minutes walk from the Kensal Green Underground station and was on the Bakerloo line so great for central London.
Joel was quick to respond during the whole process and answered all of our questions. Though we did not meet him, but Joel's father - Ariel, gave us the key and was awesome, very helpful and friendly.
We would recommend staying at Joel's flat during your trip to London.

La chambre et la salle de bain etaient propres et bien equipés. David est très sympa et s'est rendu disponible lorsque necessaire. Ma niece a beaucoup apprécié qu il mette des draps rose! Je retournerai chez lui si je retourne à Londres.

Overall, the stay is fantastic for the value. The room is quaint and beautiful and we appreciated the sweet finishing touches (coffee, tea, etc).
Only con was that it was pretty far from the center, we only stayed two nights so we didn’t buy an oyster card and just used uber which was a 30 minute drive to and from the center each time.
Overall we enjoyed our short stay and although I did not have a chance to meet Ethel I am sure she is just as sweet and hospitable as her husband."

The room itself is lovely and spacious especially the bathroom. The bed has expensive linings and makes for a great night sleep. The house is quiet.  Her little binder of notes and reccomendations was well appreciated. I highly suggest the Little Italian place down the street. One of the best airbnb hosts ever.

The flat is spacious and full of light, and is very comfortable. The bedroom is very generous in size and has a great aspect to the south east.
In my opinion their location is absolutely perfect for anyone visiting London. They live opposite the Kennington tube station. This makes getting to West End a cinch. In fact you can even walk it in under 60 minutes.
I can’t recommend Guy & James’s place more highly. If you stay, you won’t be disappointed."

His tips on a walk along the channel close by was great and the view from primrose hill (which we were completely unaware of until Enrico mentioned it) were invaluable. The marylebone station is close by and Enricos video showing how to get there the fastest by foot was beyond words- we would have been walking in circles without it.

There are many mirrors in the bedroom that were streaked and spotted and not wiped clean, there was dust on the base of the table (also mirrored and this easily visible). The back of the toilet, the wall tiles and sinks in both wash rooms were unclean. The wifi was also unreliable. We also had to wait outside the building for 30 minutes in 50 degree weather because a previous guest lost the sensor to get in and we needed another resident to let us in, in which time Tony did not respond to messages as to who could let us in. Inexpensive stay but know what you are getting."

 I always worry about booking things online so asked Amy If it was possible to view the property before booking as I live nearby.  
She replied immediately and I went to meet her at the house.  Amy also helped me with the booking also, I then needed to extend it by a few days and she made this possible for us.
It is exactly as it has been described, a family home.
Our guests were really pleased with the property and how close it is to the underground station and  supermarket.  Its also really spacious with a great garden as well. there were  also had several sets of keys which was amazing as everyone wanted to do different things.
Everything was clean and spare linen/towels were available.  Kitchen very well equipped.
Mandu the cat was no trouble at all just coming for food and then we hardly saw her the rest of the day.   After having the home comforts of Amy's house I don't think our guests would stay in a hotel again when visiting London.

The House:  What a gorgeous, perfect Mews home. I've walked by these lovely places for years and finally had a chance to stay in one. The decor was just right, tons of natural light which I love, and was always super tidy and comfortable. I felt I could relax right away. The room and bed were also perfect for me. Super comfortable and newly redone. The bathroom was very modern, great shower, bathtub, super clean and the house temperture was always warm and cozy. 

The Location: What's not to love about the location. Perfectly situated in the Maida Vale/Little Venice area of London. Lots of great ethnic restruants, chip shops, pubs wine stores and a couple small grocery stores on the corner. There is a larger Sainsbury's a few blocks away as well for any larger shopping, cash machine etc... I'm a light sleeper and the house and street was totally quiet at night for me, slept great. 

The Host: The best Airbnb host so far! Rhian made me feel right at home straight away. Beyond helpful, out going, funny and was always there if I had any questions or needed anything. Her dog was such a nice addition to the home, super cute, friendly and a joy to have around the house. I'm so looking forward to staying at Rhian's place on my next trip to London. "

이전에 머물렀던 게스트가 남긴 음료와 음식들이 개인실 내 냉장고에 그대로 남아있었어요. 체크인 직전에 대충 청소한 것 같아보였는데 많이 불쾌했습니다.
공용부엌 내 쓰레기통은 5일동안 한번도 비우지 않았어요.

The host: what can I say? George was fantastic. He was very friendly and welcoming without being intrusive and we had some interesting chats, I even learnt a bit about electrical work! He often shared meals with me and went out of his way to help me with medicine, water and food when I was sick for a few days. He was such a great host and really went above and beyond.

The spaces are rather small but certainly adequate for a family of four.  I believe that the description given is that it accommodates six but I'm not sure that it would do so comfortably.  There are two bathrooms- the only place during our 10 day journey offering this amenity.  Oddly enough, there are no outlets in the bathrooms (not the only stay we had in the UK where this was true) meaning that my wife had to do much of her morning preparations standing in front of a mirror in the bedroom.  There is indeed a fair amount of muffled train noise from below as others reported but it did not bother us.  The apartment is along a psuedo-busy street but we didn't hear vehicles and pedestrian noise at all.  One nice touch was FANS in every sleeping area.  We definitely appreciated this not because it was especially hot but because we all habitually sleep with fans.  The apartment is well equipped, has a washer and dryer and laundry soap is provided.  All in all a very good stay."

Beware the strict cancellation policy!

Upon arrival, we found a dirty and hot place. There were hairballs in the carpet and sticky kitchen utensils. It seemed that the apartment was heated, but the problem is that it is very hard to ventilate. The air coolers the host provided made the situation only marginally better - it was very unpleasant to stay in in the afternoon and evening.

The apartment is in close distance to Shoreditch and Columbia Road, both great places and in walking distance to Old Street station. 

However, we found the location very unpleasant. The apartment is just on the outskirts of Shoreditch (if at all). It is just over an extremely noisy road (sirens and human shouts day and night). Plus, there is a striptease place just down the block, making it very unpleasant to walk there at night time. 

Host tried to make things better (aircoolers, a cleaner). The main issues, however, are hard or impossible to correct."

Everything as described and as a family visiting London it was great for us, we mostly used the Thames clipper to get into town, which was more fun than the DLR. What makes this place though is the host, everything taken care of and so considerate and attentive. Our first airbnb experience and it couldnt have been better."

4927937,269489621,27/05/2018,161480809,Ann Marie,"I had a lovely stay at Judith's flat in London.  It was a 7 minute walk from the tube to her flat.  She met me upon check in and was super friendly and helpful throughout my stay.  She happened to be home from traveling during my stay (which I was aware of in advance), so I was able to meet her and we crossed paths one morning and one or two nights upon my return home.  She was helpful with tips to visit in London and made me feel right at home.  I was able to use a shelf in her refrigerator for some food I picked up at the market.  The bed was super comfortable as well.  Only issue was the challenge to unlock the front door - sometimes I could easily get in, and other times it took me 5 minutes or more to get my key to unlock the door.  Overall, not a major issue considering the room, location, and host are all great!  I hope to visit again and would recommend this room!"

Apartment was small and clean, for that location and that price - everything was perfect. Very nice and quiet district. Ideal for not a long staying. Easy to reach all  sights by underground. Shops and some cafes are close to apartment. 
At the end of our stay I wanted the bathroom to be a little cleaner because we were sharing bathroom with another guests. Otherwise everything was good. 
Huge advantage that there is a coach stop not far from the apartment and we easy got to Luton airport. 
Thanks, Ben! For your fast communication."

The rooms are very clean and while my single was physically more restricted than the photos show it would be hard to find better than this for a similar price.

Deepa and Trenton are very good hosts. I felt very welcome from the beginning and you could always have a chat or ask for advices when they were at home. They have a little daughter who is lovely. In general there is a very charming and warm athmosphere in this place.

We had a couple of minor niggles (we had to go and buy hand soap for all the basins, for instance) but overall it suited our group for a couple of nights. The kitchen/dining area is lovely for socialising and it was great to have the small outside space as the weather was so good during our stay. We weren't sure what to do with rubbish/recycling, so ended up having to leave it for the cleaner in the kitchen, which I would have preferred not to do. "

11837946,213220357,20/11/2017,2861195,Cayden,"I stayed at Mary's for a short weekend getaway after work brought me to London for a few days. The room is, as advertised, a full bed in a third-floor space. The bed's very comfortable! The decor is charming and cozy, and the skylights really do fill the place with light during the day. The bathroom was recently remodeled and is beautiful and clean.

I found Mary to be a friendly host, happy to make sure my needs were met, and make a little conversation, but left me to my own devices for most of my stay, which is what I was hoping for. I felt welcome and safe in her home.

The location is great - it doesn't take long to hop on the Underground to get to fun things to do in London, but the neighborhood is very quiet, diverse, and laid back."

Only thing I’d like to add is that you should probably bring your own towels as they don’t have any in the apartment. Other than that, I loved my stay here and wish I had more time to enjoy it."

11359511,133263467,21/02/2017,665165,Torrey,"Pros: the space is big and bright with plenty of room for a family. We loved the layout of two rooms on the top floor and one on the ground floor. The location is also really good. Easy to walk up to High Street and jump on a double decker bus or the tube.

Cons: there is a washing machine but no dryer. Be warned. There were random light bulbs out. Not a deal breaker just strange. There were no instructions left for us so we couldn't find things like extra soap or trash bin liners, or figure out where to dispose of our rubbish. The upstairs sink didn't drain well. And we were never able to get in touch with the host in order to get a second set of keys.

Bottom line, we were comfortable during our stay, but not impressed. We wouldn't stay at this flat again or recommend it to friends, sadly, because it had such amazing potential. "
29894161,539881761,02/10/2019,1626885,Amber,This is a lovely little spot to stay in Brixton. Donna is super chill and kind person.

We thoroughly enjoyed our week in Jack and Emma’s flat at 546 Caledonian Road. They were there to greet us and walk us through to orient us to the essentials — which keys for which doors, how to open and shut windows and blinds, how to adjust heat, WiFi codes, etc. In preparation for our arrival, they had even stocked the fridge and cupboard with fresh milk, juice, butter, jam, and bananas, much appreciated until we could do our own shopping. A vase of fresh flowers was a welcoming touch!
The apartment was spacious and well-kept, just as illustrated in the online photos. We especially enjoyed the monumental floor-to-ceiling windows, both in the lounge and in the bedroom—in both cases looking out on leafy quiet yards. The enclosed back garden was huge and peaceful with birdsong and bright geraniums. We made use of the outdoor table and chairs for al-fresco meals. The kitchen, of course, is small, but quite fine for simple preparations, and opens onto the back garden.
One of the best things for us was the location, on the Picadilly Line  just a couple of blocks north of the Caledonian Road tube station, giving direct access to Heathrow airport, Kings Cross/St Pancras Station, the British Library, the British Museum, etc. The #91 bus stops right outside the front gate, taking one on a direct line through town to Trafalgar Square, with stops at KingsCross, the British Library, the British Museum. 
We expect to stay here again, and will certainly recommend it to friends!

They provided every accommodation we could have asked for, towels, our own bathroom, refrigerator space, a closet, desk, shampoo and even a hair dryer located in the dresser. They were welcoming and wanted to get to know us even for our short stay. They gave us our own key and we were able to come and go freely. Their apartment was spacious, bright and very clean. The location was exactly what we were looking for, outside of the city but close enough to get there in decent time. There are at least 4 bus stops near the apartment that will take you to almost any underground line you need to get to London's city center. It only took about 30 minutes to get into the heart of London. There was a small convenience store right across the street and also a McDonalds close by for a midnight snack run, it was about a 5 minute walk away. Our stay was everything we hoped it would be, we highly recommend this lovely couple and their wonderful home!"

3855375,23803124,10/12/2014,5876285,Hiba,"Paul is the most wonderful host - he is very relaxed, hospitable and super helpful. The town house was modern, spacious and easily accessible by metro. It was about a 7 minute walk to Kings Cross station, which is one of the  most convenient in London! We took the Eurostar to Paris and it was SO easy to get there. The bedroom and bathroom were clean, although there were other airbnb guests staying at the house and sharing the bathroom. The only downside is that the house can be quite loud - you can hear people going up and down the stairs and our room (on the third floor) was right by the bathroom so we could hear every time someone opened the faucet or was in the shower. If you are a light sleeper like me, I recommend packing some earplugs. "

The location is good: close to a local park, restaurants, groceries. The place felt very much like a small hotel, check in and check out was hands off, (though I'm sure if you're looking for people to chat with, you could with the other guests!) Overall a great stay.

7415056,106086970,04/10/2016,80920538,Dylan,"This apartment is run by Lloyd and his lovely mother Angie. They are top class hosts, simply put. As a foreign student needing a short term place to stay for a month near my previous residence this popped up as a choice. Lloyd had just put his apartment up for a stay after refurbishing his place. As the fortunate first person to review this place after the works were done, I must say it is bang for your buck. Definitely not the cheapest on the market, but the full value of every penny you spend is realized. I have zero complaints - great location a minute away from Tower Hill DLR, a further three minutes walk and you're at Tower Hill tube. Nice bars and restaurants within the area, not too extensive in terms of budget dining options but what was there was good enough for me. Apartment-wise, it is a cosy as can be, spacious, well-equipped for all your living needs - from the kitchen to bathroom to laundry, and in a reasonably quiet stretch of road a short walk away from the hustle and bustle of the touristy Tower Bridge. All my queries and requests for a smooth stay at the apartment were met by Lloyd and Angie. Really the only hiccup that occurred was on one freak Saturday, water supply to the whole building block was stopped in the morning, but even that was fixed by afternoon. This is the place to stay if you want a comfortable, quiet setting for your affairs. Absolutely no regrets booking this, and I highly recommend it to anybody who wants as pleasant an experience as I had for a straightforward stay for a stretch of time in London."

It could do with a fan as you're right on the street and you can hear everything if your window is open. When closed it's very well insulated from outside activity. As a host Tikiri was helpful and made my overnight stay comfortable. Place is very well situated with a small grocery store across the street and coffee/bars just up the way."

Easy to reach by public transport, around the Corner from Portobello Market and with direct connections to Camden Town and the Center. Small groceries stores and a Sainsbury Local in the immediate area, plus the Union Tavern is worth a visit. If you're a cat lover, try to count all of them backyard cats (hint: there's a few twins ;) If you want to stay in this area, I'll highly recommend this place."

Die Kommunikation vor und bei der Anreise hat gut geklappt. wir wurden von Sam's Mitbewohner sehr herzlich empfangen und uns über alles was wichtig ist Informiert. Die Aussicht die diese Wohnung bietet ist einfach einmalig, man sieht über London soweit das Auge reicht! Der Victoriapark ist gleich über die Strasse und hat einen super coolen Spielplatz, mein Sohn hatte riesen Spass! Es hat die verschiedensten Einkaufsmöglichkeiten gleich in der nähe. Bus, Zug und U-Bahn Verbindungen sind auch super. Diese Doppelzimmer/Wohnung kann ich nur empfehlen."

However, Jason, who is the supporter before our arrival, gave a thorough guide to clear up any questions about the flat. And during our stay, Jayme and Hannah gave a very warm welcome to the house so that we could feel we were staying at home. They are really friendly. 

The flat was very clean and well maintained just as it is described by Jayme and other guests, and the town was also full of a variety of entertainment with many recommended bars and restaurants.

It is a bit far from famous attraction points like London Eye, the Tower Bridge and etc., I could experience the local environment where Londoners enjoy their daily lives.

Definitely recommend Jayme's flat."

The only minus is that you cannot lock the door of your apartment. It’s an entire house that is probably airbnb only and once you are in you cannot lock the door of your apartment from outside! 
Otherwise it was perfect"

I was lucky enough to stay in Mirko's wonderful studio for a couple of nights for my 21st! We had spontaneously booked the trip and arrived all within the space of 18 hours. The studio is extremely secure, sparkling clean, luxurious and has amazing amenities with superb, easy to follow instructions on how to self-check in. Nadia the co-host had excellent communication and graciously allowed us to check out slightly later than planned which made our departure much easier. Suffice to say that I will be back, and would not hesitate to recommend this gem of a studio to friends, family and fellow AirBnB'rs; you will NOT be disappointed! Thank you so much."

227502,1455717,11/06/2012,151638,Anita,"Amazing location with truly unbeatable transport right at your doorstep, including 24-hour buses, plus two Tube stops (Old Street and Liverpool Street) and the Shoreditch High Street Overground station within walking distance. 

Comfortable bed, well-equipped kitchen, and easy access via a keypad system. Great restaurants, bars, and shops nearby, including a well-stocked natural grocery store less than a block away. Easy stroll to Columbia Road flower market and the Broadway Market street stalls.

You're right on top of some of Shoreditch's hottest clubs, so Friday/Saturday nights can be rather lively into the wee hours. But honestly, the double windows take care of 90% of the noise. We were concerned about the Overground train running along the bridge situated right across the road, but we didn't hear it at all: It's electric and quieter than a car.

Due to a problem with BT, we had no internet access at the flat during our stay. However, DQ agreed to give us a partial credit for the inconvenience, and both he and Colin (the on-site manager) were easily reached during our stay."

Blair was very accommodating, very helpful whenever we have questions regarding directions and suggestions. The area is very nice and we loved walking around the nearby areas.

Catalina avait prévu une documentation conséquente sur l'environnement proche, des idées de ballades originales dans Londres.

L'appartement est idéalement situé, à deux pas d'une station de métro et à 10 minutes du London Eye. Très proche du centre de Londres sans l'agitation. La découverte du South Bank de Londres est une agréable surprise.

Une adresse à retenir!"
19150879,497029227,28/07/2019,62666709,Digne & Musa,Jo and Tom were wonderful hosts! Their place and the surrounding town of Enfield was amazing- grocery stores were short walks away and the two train options to get into central London were close to the flat as well. Their responsiveness and hospitality were greatly appreciated and I definitely recommend them for anyone interested!

Absolutely recommended."

If you stay and are needing all three rooms, note that the front bedroom gets a lot of street noise and with the pub down the street and early start of waste removal and commuters you will have late nights and very early mornings.  

That said, we would have been up late anyway. Violet left a list of things to do in London and places to eat with some good recommendations. We had a great visit!"

La chambre est spacieuse avec une table pour travailler, un bon wifi, un lit confortable et une grande salle de bain (partagée) propre et fraîche.
Le quartier est (très) multiculturel. Prévoir 15 minutes de marche pour se rendre à la station de métro (le GPS est pratique la première fois). La ligne relie directement Victoria Station.
Quelques restaurants typiques autour du métro.
Parfait pour se rendre à Excel. Rapport qualité/prix imbattable."

12399394,666764898,21/09/2020,31705042,Aneel,"Please read this, I think it’s important for future guests to be aware of what they may be getting themselves into. I got the biggest room of the 3 so my review is based on that room and my experiences. 

I have lived in London for a year previously and know my way around, and I can tell you that this location is really good. Very close to Lambeth North tube station and easy walk to Central London. Really close to the River Thames so you can get a nice walk. Some pubs and small corner stores are close by as well if you need anything, though the nearest grocery stores are about 10-20 minutes walk away. Room is big, spacious and clean. Has a terrace door that can open to a grass-patch area. A little uncomfortably warm during the summer, however, especially because the duvet is quite thick. 

Regarding the host: 
In my opinion, she is a micromanager, unlike any AirBnb host I've ever had (or even couchsurfing hosts). She sent me more than 10 messages prior to checking in to inform me of the rules of the place (she could have just put them in her listing online). On one day, I left the terrace door slightly open when I was in the room because of how warm it was, within 10 minutes I got a text asking me to remember the rules about the terrace door, so I may have been watched in my room, which I feel may be a privacy and security concern. 
She also accused me of damaging her kitchen countertop. She insisted that it was definitely me as she asked the other guests and they denied any involvement (she even said one of them only eats fruits, lol?). She even called me dishonorable for not letting her know as soon as I damaged her kitchen, when I cannot even confirm if it was me or someone else. I had never even seen the damage so I had no idea what she was talking about. Then, she insisted I compensated her for that and came up with a figure of £140.00 based on some random receipts from June 2019 (she only gave me those receipts when I requested, otherwise she would have just gone along with that figure) and even actually told me that it wasn't a big sum, I was a nice boy, she also understands psychology (based on my current occupation) and that she was in debt, so I should be able to afford the £140. I have texts of all of this for proof. 

I told her I did not agree with this and we should let AirBnb do a formal investigation and that I would not be paying anything until the investigation was over. Then she called me to say the same exact things she had said over text (I was a nice boy, she was in debt, she also understands psychology, blahblah). I told her over the phone the same thing, that I would rather let AirBnb investigate first. She was agreeable to that, but then the next day asked me for money again! It was like our conversations never happened. I even told her I was at work and couldn’t speak but she kept at it for a while on the phone. I again told her that I was waiting for an AirBnb investigation to take place, to which she agreed. And the next day she called me again the next day to state her 'disappointment' that I was not agreeable as we had discussed (even though we both agreed to letting AirBnb take over). She called me repeatedly to explain her circumstances even though I told her I was at work (I work in the A&E in the hospital so it is hard for me to take calls). She just kept repeating over and over the whole nonsense about her being in debt thanks to COVID, that since I work in the psychology field I must be a nice boy, that she understands psychology, and all that over and over again. She kept pushing me for the £140, and later said I can split it with one of the other guests if I wanted. For some reason, she never once accused the third guest living in the house. 

The location is great, but dealing with Marie is extremely stressful and not worth your peace of mind. I do not recommend this place."

Home is very stylish, very comfortable bed, and all the amenities thoughtfully provided. Katherin is a wonderful hostess and quite flexible. And the bonus of the two unusual cats who are very friendly wasnthe icing on the cake. Her home will be my first choice whenever in Londontown."

There was a gateleg table in the room that made a great workstation for my laptop, and the wifi always had a strong signal. I enjoyed having the convenience of the sink in the room, too. Carole provides a basic breakfast, with her homemade jams! During my stay, Carole had to be away for a few days due to an emergency, but she went the extra mile to make sure that I was taken care of in her absence. I wouldn't hesitate to stay with Carole again the next time I'm in London."

We had been warned (on AirBnB) by the radio show of Linden on Saturday, so we were not surprised.

Excellent week-end ! A Frenchman recommends this accommodation!"

She met us at the property, which was clean, tidy and ideally located for Olympia and showed us around. She even accommodated us for an extra night at an inconvenience to her, when I realised I had only booked for one night rather than two. 

Can’t recommend highly enough!"
22536843,330111327,30/09/2018,45075943,Ben,"This is a lovely little flat in the Dulwich area of London.   There are good links to the centre of London via bus or train, and plenty of information regarding transport and other things in the area provided by Tamsin for guests in the flat.
Tamsin herself was quick to respond if I had any questions and approached me ahead of time with information regarding location and how to get in, and generally had good communication.
The flat itself has a full kitchen with everything you may need, as well as a lovely lounge with access to apple TV.  The bedroom and bathroom were both clean and you can tell were kept nice.  The flat itself is not massive, however it does a lot with the space it has.


If you are looking for somewhere to stay in London, don't want to pay the high prices of the central hotels and don't mind travelling to get to the centre then I would highly recommend this space as a home away from home that you can use as a base to do such things.  My experience was overwhelmingly positive and I would recommend."

Not a far walk from the tube and one block from the main road where all the restaurants and coffee shops are. It does take 20-30 min on the tube to get to the main areas in London, but a great stay if you have the time. Gordon is very helpful and accommodating to all your questions and needs.

It could get quite hot at night so it would be great to have a fan in the room. They have provided plenty of towels but a few of them had stain on them and the quality wasn't great. Kitchenware were well equipped, however there wasn't any tea bags or coffee to provide for guests.

Toni hat uns bei der Ankunft in der Wohnung sehr nett empfangen, uns alles gezeigt und war auch während unseres Aufenthaltes immer per Handy erreichbar. Das ganze Wohnhaus ist komplett neu. Die Wohnung ist sehr geschmackvoll und modern eingerichtet und sehr sauber. Handtücher lagen genügend bereit, und die Küche ist gut ausgestattet. Die Lage ist für Sightseeing-Touren perfekt, da die Wohnung nur ein paar Minuten von der U-Bahn-Station Stockwell entfernt liegt. Mit der Northern Line ist man z.B. in 15min in der Innenstadt bei der London Bridge. Direkt vor dem Haus ist außerdem eine Busstation. Mit dem Bus dauert es zwar ca. eine halbe Stunde, ist aber trotzdem empfehlenswert. Die Wohnung befindet sich im 4.Stock. Im Erdgeschoß des Wohngebäudes befindet sich ein Lidl-Markt, was sehr praktisch ist, um zum Frühstück frisches Gebäck zu kaufen.

21892168,704536248,27/10/2020,12532074,Elizabeth,"Not exactly what we expected. The apartment is charming and even though it’s not exactly in the best part of Chelsea, the area felt safe. The main problem during our brief stay (we booked a week and only stayed less than 12 hours) was that the radiators were very slow to warm up and we spent 7h in a cold apartment (16C - 58F). Not very comfortable during mandated  covid quarantine and after a red eye flight. We moved before night felt afraid of being too cold at night. It was a cold and wet fall day in London. The deal breaker was when we realized that we could not even use the kitchen as plates and kitchenware were filthy and filled with moldy black remnants of food. The management agreed to refund  our stay, minus the first night, that we didn’t even use (as we arrived early in the morning). All in all, not a terrible place, it’s big by London standards and charmingly decorated with quirky and personal details, but make sure the heating system is working before your arrival and that the kitchenware and linens were properly cleaned by the host."

The maisonette is a gem and really homey with a lovely garden out back and a view over Sydenham from the breakfast table. The room might be little but it's cosy and comfortable. On nights in I was content to curl up in the chair and watch Netflix on my laptop. Mathew himself was an excellent host, and I was well looked after (including dragging my enormous case up the stairs for me). He was a wealth of information on things to do and where to find things and such, and good company over a tea or a gin. Would absolutely stay here again next time I'm in London. Thanks, Mathew!"

6040128,608735625,21/02/2020,5397637,Michelle,"This was one of the best Airbnb stays I’ve had. 

Denise & Trevor are wonderful hosts, well organised (as a fellow-host, I got some useful tips), friendly and charming. I really enjoyed chatting to one or both of them and hearing their intriguing stories.

The house is well-placed for rail and bus connections (the National Express coach from Stansted stops just minutes away in Golders Green). We were able to get a regular bus from the end of the road to London city centre. By the way, there are great charity shops nearby - I got some lovely little souvenirs there.

We ate in the local Giocomo’s Italian restaurant. Father and son owners are charming and the food was delicious - we even bought some of the biscotti to take away. We saw a fascinating play “The Haystack” at the Hampstead Theatre and a film at the VUE cinema complex. I visited historic Kennington House and the nearby Camden Art Centre, which has interesting exhibitions, a great café and a Stitch ‘n Bitch group - so bring your knitting!

Overall, this is a great value, comfortable, cosy home-from-home - I can highly recommend it."

Located 8mins walking distance from Tottenham hale (which is in Victoria line). Neighbourhood is peaceful. Coming to her place, it's heaven for readers and perfect for connoisseurs. I think it's a mini library filled with so many amazing books. Moreover, she has got all kind of spices and cooking utensils kept perfectly in her kitchen. Rooms and other places are exactly like the picture. She is co-operative and tried to be responsive even she was away at the time I visited."
3995541,98515119,31/08/2016,27288950,Joseph,"Tim is obviously a great host, and has a wonderful apartment. Believe all the reviews you read. My review is not five stars only because of the Notting Hill Carnival which I will get to below. Don't let my review discourage you in any way for other times of the year. Tim's flat is in a great area, lovely restaurants and stores near by and Tim is a caring and personable host. I do recommend his flat, just not during Carnival.
Interestingly (or, in our case, unfortunately) the largest street fair in Europe was taking place while we were there and we failed to understand this and the ramifications. The description included mention of the fair, but the information did cause me to to suspect anything was out of the ordinary. The fair was HUGE, it was a Rio/New Orelans type of event. The restaurants and shops were boarded up for 3-4 days. It was like a hurricane was coming as the residents stocked up in the boarded up grocery stores.  We are not Carnival type of people so we tried not to return back to the flat before 10pm, but still managed to see way more than we wanted. The kids were amused, but my wife's steely gaze made her feelings unspoken but clear.  The music started at 6am on Sunday and the music and noise went until 2:30am on both Sunday and Monday evenings. Tough to get to all the attractions when the kids need to sleep late into the morning everyday, but we scaled back and had a good visit. Ultimately the neighborhood was nothing like advertised under these circumstances. When I think of a carnival, I don't think New Orleans or Rio, I think of something closer to a street fare. I don't think of 9000 police and plywood over every place of business. 
  We still had a very good time in London and Tim's flat was a good value even under these circumstances.  It is nicely located. However we would have loved to have been able to dine in the area at the end of the day and take a leisurely stroll back to a quiet apartment. At the end I did manage to get coffee and pastries on the lat two mornings. I understand why people love Tim's place.  We just wanted to love it more. 
  In the end, if we were in London during the Carnival, we would stay as far away from Notting Hill as possible. If I returned at any other time of year, I would find this a desirable rental.

The apartment was incredibly clean, stylishly decorated, and in a great location.  We were a very easy walk to most of the major sites, but at the same time were on a quiet residential street. Damien stocked the apartment with lots of treats for us including a bottle of prosecco.  He even left fresh flowers on the dining room table.  All in all an exceptional stay.

I had everything I needed, including two towels, coffee making facilities and soap, and it was lovely to have somewhere so peaceful to come in after a busy day. I was extra-conscious to be quiet in the evenings as it is their own home and I didn't want to disturb them, so if you are a little noisier or a group it could be good to be aware of that. It was a little while out of the city, taking me just over an hour to get into the city but the transport options were easy to navigate and use. All in all, I had a great stay!"

Lots in the neighborhood, loads to walk to and easy public transport.  We arrived from Gatwick (rail then metro) and were happy to walk only a block or so more with our luggage.  Helen was responsive and everything was exactly as arranged - even allowing a bit of an early check in for the weary travellers!  Helen's recommendations were great.  Check in was a breeze and there are local markets 2 min walk to stock up essentials.  We walked to many attractions from here, and I definitely recommend walking home across over a bridge from the South Bank bridges at night - views and experiences we will never forget.  The flat is perfect - good sized and all the necessities.  There were three adult-sized people and plenty of room.  The pull out may be a bit small for two adults (we are all quite tall) but was perfect for one or two children.  We didn't use the telly but WiFi was no problem.

Fabrizio provided instant confirmation and had the room ready when I arrived. The location is a bit far from the centre of London, and the area is not exactly buzzing with nightlife, but the pricing reflects that it isn't the West End. There is some work to be finished on the bathroom, which has just been refurbished, but the host - who is friendly and helpful - clearly intends to keep improving the place."

13014325,132181884,16/02/2017,110505648,Alex,"What a great week! 

Liri went above and beyond in so many ways, it's very obvious that she thoroughly enjoys being an Airbnb host, and making sure you're enjoying your stay at her place. She's always available for questions, phone calls, tips, advice, or just to check in to see how your week is going.

There's a comment in one of her previous reviews that reads something like ""if you've come across Liri's place, and it's available, look no further because you won't find a better host/location"" and is it ever true!! 

What a strange but very cool place. When you first arrive, you'll be thrown off by its location within the building/complex, but it's truly a great space and is one of a kind.  Floors, bathroom, kitchen were all very clean,  and everything was exactly how it looks in the pictures. 
Worthwhile to note: the listing says King sized bed, but, (might be a North American vs. UK thing, as we're from Canada) we believe it's a Queen.

As for the location - it's perfect. Super close to countless breakfast/coffee shops, restaurants, shops, etc. Also, a two minute walk to Baker Street Station, which connects you with 4 underground lines, and makes it super easy to get around London. The neighbourhood itself also feels very safe, and is a busy, lively area to wander around.

Overall, our stay awesome. We felt totally at home. Thanks a ton, Liri! Hope to stay at the Glass House again."

Die Lage der Wohnung ist durch die Nähe zur U-Bahn und vielen Buslinien komfortabel. Man ist mitten drin im sehr lebendigen Stadtteil, aber die Wohnung ist auch ruhig.
Die Räume sind enger als es die Fotos von Schlaf und Wohnraum wiedergeben."

Rebecca's place is amazing and they were very happy and settled there for the week. It's stylish, cosy and very well appointed. I would recommend a stay at Rebecca's lovey home and I know my parents would stay again without hesitation."
7541508,428957014,26/03/2019,141336919,Cathal,"A cozy and welcoming family home in a quiet area just minutes' walk from the tube, the overground to Gatwick, and Clapham Common. The shelves of books and eclectic art on the walls made me feel right at home.

The house is very well located for visiting the city with easy access to central London via the Northern Line including late night tubes on Friday and Saturday.

Susan is an excellent host, very helpful and clear in her communication and made me feel right at home. A bonus for any theatre fans visiting: Susan is very clued in to the London theatre scene and offered some useful tips.

The bed was comfy and the shower had good water pressure with plenty of hot water. And as a taller-than-average traveller, I was relieved to find that I could fit comfortably into both!

I would thoroughly recommend Susan's place for anyone visiting London."

Well stocked kitchen, although was a bit tricky with no dishwasher. Bathroom was clean but a bit run down in places. 
During our stay there was a very faint piano noise for a lot of the time, as if someone upstairs was practising piano, which was a little bit annoying at times. But I guess that's staying in a flat in London. All in all it was a good stay and I would recommend it. "

We would definitely stay at her lovely home again. Thanks Marie!"

The flat is nice and clean, with all the essentials. Double-glazing means the street noise is minimal (we stayed from Thursday till Monday and were not bothered by the crowd at all, and I’m a light sleeper). The communication was perfect and timely. Overall, definitely recommend. Thanks, Tayo and Shaeren!!"

Mirjam, Hussein and their lovely son Tarkan were always so kind and helped me a lot. I always felt comfortable and other guests whom I met during my stay in the house were also very nice and cool! It's hard to put into words quite how good my stay here was. I highly recommend this place for your precious days in London.

The check in is a bit confusing but we got there. The room was OK but was so hot when we got there, we had to open all the windows and could hardly sleep. The mattress is not very good and makes a lot of noise when we turn in the bed. Finally, the bathroom and kitchen were not very clean and other guest put too much paper in the toilet, which was clogged and we had to manually unclogge it.
The apartment is cheap in comparison with the others found but we didn't had a very good stay."

Shops and subway station easy walking distance. Host was waiting when we arrived and was friendly and helpful. That said, the house is spread on 4 floors with steep stairs, the toilets don't flush too well and often don't clear out everything they should, and on our last day rain came in through the kitchen roof and soaked the kitchen table. Despite these issues which I would normally consider serious, it did not impact our stay significantly, we had a great time, and the house suited our 3 generation family very well. "

Everything about our stay was wonderful – the house is even better than the pictures – so spacious (bedrooms are huge - easily enough space for 12), beautifully finished and decorated (a couple of bridesmaids planning extensions in their own houses were taking inspiration from Georgia’s amazing kitchen/diner/sliding doors) so much natural light (perfect for “getting ready” photos!), the kitchen is brilliantly kitted out, making cooking for everyone very easy, and we loved the garden for early evening Friday drinks. A few wedding morning nerves were bounced out on the trampoline!!  We all wanted to move in if I’m honest! Comms with Georgia were perfect, so friendly and helpful and she quickly helped resolve an error with the cost made by Airbnb. This house has a place in our hearts as it was such a beautiful backdrop to our wedding weekend. Thank you Georgia!!"

Many other pubs, cafe's, restaurants, and shops can be accessed by a short walk down the road, however would recommend returning in an Uber or taxi as the hill the apartment is situated atop is quite steep. All in all it was an enjoyable stay within a comfortable setting, and Andrew went above and beyond with accommodating our check-in and check-out requirements. Communication was excellent overall, however we were a little disappointed with the no smoking policy for the balcony, as we had specifically booked a place with a balcony for this reason. I feel this could be communicated a little clearer in the initial advertisement."

Easy to get to stations on various tube lines (in a radius of 10 mins walk or so) to get towards all sorts of other places, if you like. There's also a huge Westfield mall in walking distance if you're into high-end shopping, the apartment building offers a small supermarket for the essentials.

Check-in was smooth and easy, Ruby met me at the apartment and we sorted out everything in a couple of minutes. The place is very clean and organised and as described in the listing. I had a very good stay, would certainly book it again if I'm back in the area."

There were also several wonderful touches, such as a mini bar and a tips for local restaurants, etc. The location is perfect--both a bit out of the way of the crowds of central London, but very easily accessible to everything you'd want to visit (it is less than a 5 minute walk to the tube station where you can get both the District and Piccadilly lines, which, among other things, means it's an easy trip to/from Heathrow airport).

El propietario de la vivienda, sin llegar a cancelar la reserva, y con los pagos ya efectuados por nuestra parte, nos mandó un escueto mensaje a escasos día del tipo ""ya no me viene bien alquilároslo el inmueble, ahí os quedáis"", encima no llegando a cancelar , por si acaso se nos pasaba y encima se quedaba con la transferencia ya emitida. Con suerte, estando en el aeropuerto, a 3 horas de llegar al destino, descubrimos la situación, llamamos por teléfono al propietario, nos vaciló argumentando que ""le daba igual que nos dejara tirados"" y ""que no necesitaba nuestro dinero para nada"". Tras eso, hablamos con airbnb, y aparte de devolvernos el dinero (lo cual era evidente), nos ofrecieron un descuento como (Website hidden by Airbnb) 16 euros??!!?! sabéis cuánto cuesta alquilar algo para 4 días en Londres con antelación de horas?

If you want to be 2 people instead of one, you have the option of asking him, with an extra cost of 10 pounds a night, which is still a pretty nice deal. 
You get to central London in 20 minutes by public transport, and the area around Richards apartment is very nice, 2 supermarkets in walking distance and plenty of places to eat. We felt safe even when walking home after midnight."

The bed is not the most comfortable but when you are running around all of London every day, you really hardly notice. One of the days we had issues with hot water and the internet, but other than that there were no issues at all and Max and Billie were quite to respond and fix any issues. There was also a bit of noise from the road nearby and there are no curtains on the windows so occasionally their was some light coming in from the apartment below and across so pack some eye covers and maybe some ear plugs if you are a sensitive sleeper. Otherwise a great place to stay!"

The flat is as pictured and the description is remarkably accurate (even to where the small pots of house plants are). Being fans of architectural history, my parents loved the flat and the finer details of the property that oozes Georgian architecture. 
Loved the welcome pack that Andrew sent. It was a massive help to get around the flat and the area. 
Overall, we had a wonderful time in this clean, charming and well located flat. 
My parents loved their first airbnb experience! Staying in a unique property with so much history is what drew them to airbnb in the first place. They will be back!"

The house is very simple, but has everything you need. The room is very big. The location is  very good, we walked to Portobello road from there in 10/15min. Has supermarkets close by. It's less than a 10min walk to the nearest underground station.  The neighbourhood is nice and quiet.  All in all, it was better than I expected."

23513041,340228866,23/10/2018,31308916,Gabrielle,"This apartment has everything you could need on a long vacation. I stayed with my boyfriend, two of his guy friends and one of their girlfriends. It fit 5 people comfortably. The only major thing I should warn people about are the safety concerns. (If you’re coming in from the U.S., make sure you pull the door handle up to initiate the door locks then you can lock it. None of us had ever seen locks like this before.) We called the company that runs this air bnb maybe 30 minutes after they checked us in to let them know the locks weren’t working. They responded immediately and we sent them a video of the locks not working and they told us the door was definitely broken and they couldn’t send anyone out until the next morning so we had to sleep with the doors unlocked. The next morning we had to wait around the air bnb until the locksmith came (he was late.) He was incredibly rude and said “ya Americans don’t know anything,” then continued to insult me by treating me like a child while he demonstrated how to lock the door. Mind you, I’m 25 years old. He literally said “ok now your turn,” as if he were talking to a child and forced me to show him. I don’t know if he works for the company that runs this air bnb or not, but it was incredibly insulting. Also, the main doors to the building are supposed to be locked at all times and in order to pass them you have to use your key fob. Not once on our six day trip did we need to use the key fob, the doors were unlocked at all times. All of our Uber drivers were telling us it wasn’t the best area, which we sort of guessed from the surrounding areas. (Not even the guys were comfortable.) Lastly, there is a little owl perched on the ledge in front of the apartment door which I think has a camera in it. It kind of freaked us out so be aware of that. It was an ok stay, the company was wonderful and responded quickly to our messages, the apartment had everything you could possibly need, we just didn’t feel comfortable in that area."

The flat was cozy, impeccably clean, and perfectly situated in a quiet neighborhood, but within waking distance of lots of activity.  We loved all the local spots to eat and drink, but especially the Plumtree Cafe for breakfast, Royal Teas Cafe for afternoon tea, and Richard The First Pub. Thank you so much to Yasmin for being such a gracious and responsive hostess. This was our first experience with AirbnB and everything went so smoothly, I cannot wait to try the service again. "

The tube is about a 10 minute walk, the bus stops are even closer. Very centrally located, and the perfect starting point to explore London, whether it's your first trip or whether you're a repeat visitor (like us!). The flat was very clean, and had more than enough space for my sister and I to enjoy our 3 day visit. The room was a bit chilly when we first got there, and took a while for the floor heating to kick in - but Jerome was very accommodating and brought us a space heater as well as extra comforters the second night to make sure we were warm. The bathroom is on the cozy side. Not a big deal if you take quick showers, but I tend to like long, 15 minute showers so I had to rush a bit before the hot water ran out. Just something to consider. I would highly recommend this place for its location and its proximity to all that London has to offer. Thanks for hosting us, Jerome!"

Very close to supermarkets (Tesco, Sainsbury’s, Iceland) and transportation links (bus, underground, overground). Hafsi was very quick to respond so the communications was great. I had a good experience and can recommend this room for both short and long stays."
31006013,470428491,16/06/2019,146642353,Angelica,"I went on a trip with my mother. What attracted me to Ash's listing was his apartments close proximity to the tube. It was a quick walk, which was important to us as my mother cannot walk for long periods of time. 

Ash was very accommodating to our weird check in and check out times (due very early and late flights). His communication was very effective and answered any questions we had. He even helped explain to us the confusing Tube system and gave us recommendations for places to visit and see while in London. Ash elevated our experience in London and made us feel like home and part of the family. His outstanding hospitality, quick responses, and sparking clean apartment made traveling in an unfamiliar city so much better. 

My mother called Ash a ""super host"" and that indeed is what he was. We would definitely stay at Ashes apartment the next time we travel to London if he will have us. I would recommend this listing to anyone who is planning on going to London."

You have access to 2 train stations, particularly London Bridge is a 2min walk away. However many of the main attractions in the area are walking distance so you rarely need the tube. Jacqui was very responsive to my emails and provided clear instructions for check in and information about local places. I would definitely stay here again and highly recommend it to others.

She made us feel at home from the moment we arrived with some very thoughtful touches. Her communication is excellent with very quick responses, and she is easily accessible for any questions or queries. Nothing seems to be too much trouble for Anna.
The apartment is lovely and clean, the bedroom a haven of tranquility and the shower just amazing. There is everything you require for a stay here including crockery, cutlery, glasses etc..
My daughters loved staying here, and in  particular 'the stage' in the bedroom where they put on a show.
The apartment is also a few minutes walk from the town centre and close to excellent transport links, shops etc.. there is also free parking at the front of the property, which in this area is a luxury.
It is very quiet and peaceful and perfect for  a getaway.

I really enjoyed the kitchen space, liked that we had a marked shelf per room. I liked the swivel TV in our private room. It's a 10 minute walk from the subway station, and very close to a lot of restaurants.  Nice location."

His response by both phone and messages in the AirBnB app was quick. The apartment is only a few minutes walk to Bayswater and Queensway underground stations as well as down to Hyde Park. The area is residential and has a large variety of smaller restaurants with a broad cultural span. A fairly good Tesco store for food is also close by.
The apartment has good quality beds and is fairly newly renovated."

The day before checkout was very stressful as I could not open
the entrance door with the host provided key. It turned out that the back entrance door need to be pushed forcefully which I wasn’t aware of. 

Had to wait for 3 hours for the host to come back and let me in. 
Afterwards, the host made me feel very uncomfortable by raising her voice at me.

While I understand that hosting glitches might happen, I would have forgotten about it if she handled it in a more ""host worthy ""manner. 
Indeed it is a big responsibility to be a host as your guests need to feel welcome, secure and treated respectfully."

It was extremely clean, close to the tube station, safe, and she had plenty of tips on places to eat/visit. We were slightly skeptical staying in a private room versus a whole home, but this was a game changer. I would recommend this to anyone travelling to London! "

Kian was a great host: He was very responsive during the planning stage, and very flexible to my travel. Though we didn't meet a ton in person, he checked in periodically to make sure all was well. I would note that the room is small, but if you're traveling alone, the convenience and kind host can't be beat!"

Spacious, comfortable and in a quiet neighbourhood. The Victoria line is very close by too, meaning you can be in the centre of London within minutes."
18678369,342143254,28/10/2018,1921195,Roza,"It was my second stay at Sandra's place and it was amazing again. The room is very clean and got everything you may need. Small kitchenette with fridge, microwave and kettle are very convenient, the basics like tea/coffee/milk are there and also croissants that Sandra provides for the breakfast(jam, butter, orange juice are there too). 

The location is lovely, but I may be biased, as Kew is my favorite part of London. Nice running/cycle trail along the river Thames, Kew Gardens, nice sightseeing - Hamport Court,  Ham House; good connection to the city center and Heathrow airport. 

And also the cat, Hendrix is very cuddly:)"
5640854,172940161,22/07/2017,43461007,Donovan,Jades place was perfect. Exactly how it looks in the photos and in a great location. There is a market right next to the apartment that makes things very convenient. Would recommend this apartment to anyone.

Her flat is lovely: clean, bright, spacious and very comfortable. I never wanted or lacked a thing, and had absolutely NO disappointments. The bed is comfortable, and the bedroom has plenty of space to tuck away your things. Ample towels and an endless supply of fresh wash cloths (which is appreciated!) are provided, and a large variety of body washes is available in the bright, always clean bathroom.

Breakfasts were elegant and delicious. I enjoyed a leisurely cup of coffee each morning  at the dining table by the huge windows - a great place to plan out your day.

Her location is brilliant. Just off of Russell Square, it's close between two tube stations (Piccadilly and Central lines) and is only a 15 minute walk to the Thames. The British Museum is practically next door. Amazing variety of restaurants within steps of her building. The tube provides easy and cheap access to and from Heathrow.

I most certainly will be back to London, and when I am, I'll be staying with Davina!"

It takes about 1hr to get to London city center but quite worth the transit for a quiet neighborhood. Jing was super nice: my flight was delayed and didn't get to her place until 2am but she was still up to help me. I would recommend people staying at her place!
13393011,262810504,10/05/2018,118009408,Sunbin,"집값 높은 런던에서 가성비 최고인 숙소입니다. 특히 1존 안에 있다는 점이 여행할 때 정말 편리했습니다. 지하철 역은 도보로 15분 거리에 있지만 버스 정류장이 5분 거리에 위치해 있어서 주요 관광 지역으로 나가는데 전혀 불편함이 없었어요. 테이트 모던이 도보 30분 거리에 위치해 있을 정도로 멀지 않아서 저는 집에 돌아올 땐 걸어서 왔습니다.
집 내부도 깨끗한 편이고 인테리어도 딱 제가 상상하던 영국인의 집이었어요. 호스트는 젊은 부부였는데 토스트, 바나나, 우유, 시리얼 등을 제공해줘서 아침엔 이것들을 먹고 나갔습니다. 주말엔 호스트가 집에 내내 있었는데 브라우니도 만들어줬습니다. 호스트가 환경을 많이 생각하는 분이어서 재활용도 꼼꼼히 하는 편이고 저는 일회용 쓰지 말자는 의미에서 젓가락도 선물 받았습니다.
제가 쓴 방은 작긴 했지만 혼자 쓰기엔 아늑하고 또 다른 게스트랑 친해져서 같이 저녁도 먹고 좋았습니다 :) 강력 추천해요!!"

17689138,435389017,10/04/2019,22236310,Kaman,"The best thing about this bnb is the location: on the ground floor & 3-4min walk from paddington tube/Heathrow express station. I do not like walking up the stairs with heavy suitcases. Even though it’s on the ground floor it’s a very quiet neighbourhood as it is a few streets away from the restaurants/pubs. 

Gabe is nice and sensible. He lived on the premise during our stay. Elizabeth room is spacious,clean and warm (ambience and temperature). The beddings are too soft for my liking but the sheets/towels/floor/furniture are clean. 

The apartment has a very cute layout. The Elizabeth room is located furthest from the toilet so you don’t have to hear flushing sound at night. 

Even though Gabe, another family and us stayed together we did not need to wait for toilets/bathrooms. I stayed for 3 nights and the washrooms were always available whenever I needed it. 

I would say overall it was a very pleasant stay."

4229713,28340127,22/03/2015,27227435,Alessa,"This was our first time in London and with Airbnb and it was a great experience. Lucy and Ruby the cat were amazing hosts and made us feel like home immediately. She offered us everything from her kitchen and bathroom, explained us the public transport system, etc. and treated us like friends.
The room was exactly like in the pictures. It's a beautiful and cozy room with an amazing bed. It is just above the street but surprisingly quiet. We appreciated the fresh flowers a lot ;)
Public transport is very simple from there. You can take a direct bus to London Bridge that takes about an hour or bus + underground (about 36min).
We definitely recommend Lucy's place to everyone who wants to live in a nice and comfortable place near the city centre and be around nice people.

12518330,555148555,27/10/2019,284271627,Jennifer,"Nous avons beaucoup apprécié ce séjour à deux dans le studio de Peter, situé dans une jolie rue calme. Il est certes petit, mais largement suffisant. Tout est fonctionnel est surtout vraiment très propre, ce qui a été agréable. Kitchenette bien équipée. 
L'appartement est idéalement situé, non loin à pied d'Oxford street et de Piccadilly, ainsi que du Convent Garden. Juste à côté également du British Museum. Pour le reste, le métro est à deux pas. 
Seul petit bémol pour les sommeils légers : prévoir un masque car le store n'est pas entièrement occultant. 
Une douche et des toilettes sont au rez-de-chaussée (le studio au 4ème), mais ce n'est pas si gênant car d'autres toilettes et un lavabo se trouvent sur le même pallier que le studio et les parties communes sont tranquilles, il y a peu d'appartements. 
Nous avons eu le plaisir de croiser Peter, très accueillant et gentil.
Bref : nous recommandons et reviendrons si nous en avons l'occasion !"

The space was clean, comfortable, and located in a cool neighborhood. Nice touches include tea, TV, and a water cooler in the room. I got a little confused finding the right entrance but Amy was right there to greet me. It is as advertised RE: noise from the train and people on the street, so maybe not the ideal space for light sleepers who need absolute silence. But if you're like me and sleep like the dead, you'll have no problem. Would stay again!"

It is quite nice inside, two bedrooms with two full baths, a full kitchen with pots, dishes, and utensils. It has a nice porch off the back with a table and chairs.

The primary reason is the host: Stavroula is a genuinely friendly, helpful and generous host. In addition, though, the flat is in a great location, a few minutes walk from Islington's Upper Street and the great new restaurants around Kings Cross. A few minutes walk as well to the canal (tow path) which makes for a great walk on a nice day. The flat is lovely - plenty of windows, so it's sunny. Stavroula seems to have an encyclopedic knowledge of restaurants and other things to do in the area, and has lots of great ideas. I could not recommend the place more highly, and I fully intend to stay again on my next trip to London if I can."

Acho que tem 2 pubs londrinos a 2 quadras da casa com um mercadinho com praticamente tudo que é necessário muito próximo também. A casa fica a 5 min de uma estação de metrô que te leva para qualquer canto e algumas linhas de ônibus passam a 2 quadras da casa para quando quiser retornar após o fechamento do metro , pois a linha Rosa não funciona durante toda a noite. De modo geral gostei do bairro . Caminhos durante a noite com tranquilidade com relação à segurança ."

I think my anxiety before my interview contributed somewhat to my struggling to sleep however a part of it was the fact that it wasn't as quiet and as comfortable as I had hoped. Having said this, no one else has mentioned this before in their reviews of Davina's place, so it may be that I am just too used to how quiet it is in my neighbourhood and how comfy my own mattress is!"

All I can say is that Tim and Conz are naturals at hosting they're friendly welcoming kind considerate hosts and genuine lovely people.
The whole flat is sparkling clean well decorated and furnished.

My room was extremely comfortable and cosy a good sized bed with clean bedding which made for good night sleeps and waking refreshed in the morning.
Good reliable wifi throughout the flat.
Toilet and shower room next door to room good warm shower and nice soft towels supplied.
Breakfast was laid out every morning on a help yourself basis all you need is there to get you through the day.
The area is quiet central and safe a restaurant across the road which does good cheap pub grub.
I enjoyed my time at Tim and Conzs flat it's a real find and very reasonable rates considering that it's London.

As Americans traveling during the pandemic, we remained very comfortable during our quarantine because of the multiple places for each of us to scatter to for much needed alone time. The garden was a fabulous spot to spend much of the day as well.  Also, we had an endless selection of great food that was able to be delivered. Once we were finally able to explore London, we were able to walk to so many places.  If it was not the era of Covid, the proximity to Waterloo Station and Tube stops was amazing too.  I just personally chose not to use them right now.  I also loved being in the city center but having a very quite street to return home to. Fabulous!"

It was 20 times better than the hotel at which I stayed my  first night in town.  Micci is a warm and welcoming hostess. I couldn't have been more comfortable. "

The washer+dryer was an especially nice touch, and not easy to find in the city. The location is incredible! Such an easy walk to the Baker Street tube station, which is centrally located and made it easy to get to almost all of the major sights we wanted to see while we were in London. We would definitely stay here again!"
7464204,45123358,31/08/2015,39724601,Nick,"Laura's flat was perfect for a weekend trip to London. It was easy to get to from the city and and a short walk from Brixton tube.If  you don't fancy walking, there are buses going up and down the main road all the time. The flat was great, with a super comfy bed in the main bedroom, but the best thing was the view of the London skyline from the balcony, it was amazing. A great place to sip some fizz and watch the sun set over west London. Laura was always very prompt with replying to emails and left us a lovely welcome pack. I would definately recommend  her flat as a place to stay.
P.S For those not familiar with London transport, don't try and pay by cash on the buses, the drivers seem to take offence. Oyster card of contactless cards only"

As was mentioned, this is a busy area and there is some street noise if you have the windows open. When they are closed it is fine. We didn't mind at all because we wanted the city experience.

Communication with Paul and Milka was great. They were very responsive. I highly recommend staying here, and I would do so again."

12478820,155319934,28/05/2017,37029087,Aude,Logement très bien situé mais avec un simple vitrage donc pas possible de se reposer comme il faut. Réveiller à 5h30 par les poubelles qui passent tous les jours et par la lumière du jour. Les rideaux n'occultent pas vraiment. L'appartement est propre mais mériterait un petit coup de rafraichissement. La douche est véritablement minuscule.

27454618,609602933,23/02/2020,1395199,Lucie,I would not recommend this apartment as a 2 bed unless they replace the sofa bed or provide more adequate bedding to ensure it’s comfortable to sleep on. The bedroom was cold and smelly too.

21652894,455913585,20/05/2019,17595849,Saskia,"We had a really pleasant stay at this lovely renovated light house. Communication by Lucie was clear and check in went smooth without them being there. We personally like the fact that you actually stay at a families house. It gives you a feeling of how people live and you connect more to a place.

Lucie and her family are really open and friendly. We did not spend a lot of time together but it was nice meeting them. 

The big new bathroom for ourselves was a nice surprise! Although you stay with a family you also have enough privacy because the first floor is practically yours. 

We would recommend staying here!"

The room is really spacious and bright, very clean and the kitchen has all the things you need to cook. The broadway market is wonderful on a Saturday and the flower market is a short walk down the street. The room has block out curtains and faces into a park which has many dog owners in the morning. It was a perfect place to stay for the week. Highly recommend!!"

The neighborhood is Belsize Park, close to 2 tube stops. I highly recommend Belsize Park, reason-Gail's for the best pastries right across from station. Chalk Farm is also very nice with a lot of cafes, pubs and a Tesco nearby. I met Mike as soon as I arrived and he was very friendly and answered all my questions.

Goran was abroad but his brother was very helpful with good communications, He wait for us although we have arrived late at night.
the flat is in the 6th floor of a 14 floors building with elevator. 
main door is electrically controlled.
the surrounding area is quite and nice.
the flat has nice views from all windows 
we didn't use public transport as we have our own car and didn't find difficulty on the nearby street.
Wifi working well

Negative points: cleaning is a serious issue every where in the flat.
hot water comes and goes in the shower"

Value for money"
17678562,334891216,10/10/2018,218900499,Dave,Decent accommodation and reasonable value for money for the area. The rooms were clean and tidy but very basic and in need of some decorating

Los compañeros de piso han sido muy atentos. Es una habitación sin pretensiones con lo necesario. La casa está en una zona super bien comunicada para ir al centro, a 10min de Canary Wharf. Muy contentos de nuestra estancia en casa de Daniela."
5725042,160665023,15/06/2017,120193408,Martin,"Only stayed a couple of nights. Good location being close to Paddington station, and lots of little eating places nearby.
The third floor room was clean and tidy. No wardrobe, but a shelf unit instead. Double bed was firm but comfortable.
Kitchen almost as big as bedroom and was well equipped and reasonably clean, with a fridge, microwave, gas cooker, kettle cutlery, cups etc. There was a very small amount of milk and coffee, left from previous guests?
There was an ironing board,  iron and hair dryer in the bedroom.
The television had a good picture and range of channels and WiFi was available. The shower unit, toilet and sink were tight but worked well enough, with hot water from a combi boiler.
Heavy curtains were very light proof. Leaving them drawn during the day stops the sun warming the room too much. There is a background hum from outside at night so best to close the window, but it can then get rather hot in warm weather.
Owners Litsa and her husband very hospitable and always ready to sort out any problems. One morning there was noise from an adjoining flat presumably having to leave very early, otherwise did not hear any noise from other rooms. Fair price for location and easy access for travel."
12288022,120615742,11/12/2016,97594707,Katerina,We stayed in Oxana's place for 4 days.  The place is really excellent for 2 people in a very handy location near Hyde Park.

There were some water leakage issues (rain water coming in one area of the flat) but Chris & Sam responded immediately and took care of things.  We had a wonderful stay, the location was perfect for us, the beds were very comfortable and things were clean.  The fact they responded so quickly (it even involved them coming to the flat at midnight) made any minor issues irrelevant.  We had a wonderful visit to London and would reserve the place again in a heartbeat."

The area is lovely and the neighbourhood is quiet overall, although very close to amenities such as transport and shopping. The flat is spacious and feels quite light and airy."

I walked everwhere but the tube station is also just a 5min walk. Big supermarket at the station. Only flaw: the fridge is quite loud and as I'm a light sleeper that bothered me some. But I would stay there again...with earplugs :-)"

She had the fridge stocked with the essentials to get us through breakfast until we discovered the little grocery shops down the street. 
Her location was great for us. Across the street from a nice park where you can run or take a little one to play and just down the street from the tube station for the Bakerloo line, which ended up being our lifeline into London. 
The neighborhood was quiet all times if day which was a nice retreat for the bustle elsewhere. 
You should know it is a 5 story walk up which was not an issue for us. 
Susannah was also accommodating for a Kate checkout that we needed. There was even weekly cleaning service which was nice to freshen up the flat a couple if times during our stay. 
I will definitely contact Susannah again if we come through London. "

Daniel was good at communicating before my arrival,  giving clear and easy-to-follow instructions for me to access the house easily even when he wasn't in. The lovely cat made me feel very welcome too! A very stylish but comfortable home and Daniel was friendly and easy-going so I felt at ease to use the kitchen facilities freely.  I also really appreciated the dedicated free parking spot. Will definitely return if I am working in the area again, thanks Daniel!"

The flat was just as good as described, great space, the kitchen had everything we needed. If there is one thing I can put as a negative factor was the height of the ceiling above the bed, but wasn't a problem since this gave us more space in the kitchen and sofa area. The check-in and check-out process was very simple and specifically detailed trough message before we arrive. We are very satisfied with our stay in Hanover House. Would recommend with eyes closed."

And the place has a kind of minimalist style with nice lighting. I really loved it!"

Once or twice, I had to wait for a little while after 5pm to get into the room as it is used as her office during the weekdays between 9.30am and 5pm.  Agnes herself is lovely and very friendly!

It's a hotel concept, other rooms are also rented out. I did not know this. 
Was woken up by a noisy guy at 1am two nights in a row. Second night I walked out, the guy apparently had no idea my room was rented out, too. Third night there was a party downstairs until late.

So if you want sleep, it's a gamble."
12551309,157655532,04/06/2017,64307177,Tiger,A home clearly cared for well and Salvo was instant with response to any inquiries I had over my stay. Location was convenient with Sainsbury merely five minutes or so away and the train station being even closer. Salvo even provided free Netflix which made the stay even more entertaining.

The stay is like Maria describes it and she always cares that the house is tidied up, which also means you have to care that it stays clean. If someone cant handle cats or dogs, she or he should overthink the booking. I was really fine with my one-week-stay."

There were two days I actually didn't go anywhere because I was so comfortable there and had my caffeine and ordered from Uber eats.  

Wonderful restaurants in the area that deliver. 
Two places i ordered from were 1.  Arepa & Co  ( ordered the jardinera) and 2. Salaam Namaste ( ordered bombay onion bhaji and Kori Ghasi).
Also have a code that will get you 10 pounds off your first order!

Micci also shared some wine with me and a Kit-Kat bar which was really special.

There is an abundance to public transport options including walking distance to Lancaster Gate and Bayswater underground as well as the main Paddington rail and Underground network. Don't forget the buses, a good way to get around London, lots of options to get you to the West End.
One of our favourite things to enjoy when in London is walking in Kensington Gardens and Hyde Park, these are a pleasant stroll away.
The accommodation is clean and even cereals, fruit, croissants and bread are provided for breakfast.
The booking process with Eamon and Tomas was trouble free and they provide lots of information and tips for their guests."

Supermarkt und Restaurants, sowie Pubs gleich ums Eck. Man ist hier gut versorgt und erreicht durch die gute U-Bahnanbindung schnell alle wichtigen Sehenswürdigkeiten in London und den Flughafen Heathrow. Wir kamen früh morgens in London an und konnten das Appartement erst um 15.00 Uhr beziehen. Leider hatten wir in der Nähe keine Möglichkeit gefunden das Gepäck zu deponieren. Die Wohnung befindet sich im Suterain ist aber sehr hell und die Fenster können geöffnet werden. Einzig die Stiegen zum Appartment sind eher steil und schmal. Ich kann die Wohnung wirklich weiterempfehlen!!"

And given its incredibly central location, extremely quite and and peaceful.  Small - but very well laid out - kitchen with high end appliances that does the job for small meals, and the washer dryer combo is perfect for light laundry.  And Kirsty's communication was prompt, polite and professional.  My only minor concern... no paper towels and a paper towel dispenser, only one frying pan and chopping board, and one bedroom having two single/twin beds pushed together, a personal pet peeve of mine as I do not like that crack in the middle.  And the flat is advertised on Air b n B as two queen beds.  That said, this did not distract from the fact that Kirsty's flat is immaculately clean, well appointed, extremely well managed by Kirsty herself, and in THE best location in London.  Recommended."

We had a good night's sleep and the use of the amazing private bathroom. Being able to have a quick breakfast in the kitchen was very handy too. 

The house is about 10 -15 mins walk from the West Hampstead rail, overground and tube stations, so it was equally easy to get to the Hamstead Heath park, Central London and the St Pancras station from there. 

We really enjoyed the experience, and wouldn't hesitate to recommend this room to anyone."

Vor und während der Reise war die Kommunikation mit Dejan hervorragend, er ist ein sehr fürsorglicher, sympathischer und hilfsbereiter Gastgeber. Obwohl wir uns verspätet hatten und Dejan eigentlich zu einem Termin musste, hat er sich trotzdem die Zeit genommen, uns das Apartment ausführlich zu zeigen und erklären.

Die Wohnung war sehr sauber und ordentlich, wir hatten auch viel Platz für unsere eigenen Sachen. Alles ist einfach zu bedienen. Da Dejan sonst selbst im Apartment wohnt, hat es eine persönliche sehr angenehme Atmosphäre - wir haben uns vollkommen heimisch gefühlt.

Da ich gehbehindert und auf einen Rollator angewiesen bin, war der barrierefreie Zugang auf dem Gelände und im Haus für mich sehr wichtig : absolut keine Probleme.

Optimal war für mich auch die Lage der Bushaltestelle nur 10 Meter vom Ausgangstor entfernt. Mit dem 25er ist man nach 3 Stationen an der Stratford Station mit diversen Linien von Underground (Central Line ins Zentrum, Jubilee zur Southbank, z.B. The Shard und Millennium Eye), Overground, Dockland Light Rail (DLR) und TfL-Rail. Tipp : mit der DLR bis Royal Victoria, dann mit der Gondelbahn über die Themse nach Greenwich und weiter mit der Fähre bis Westminster / Big Ben. Zwar nicht im Verbundtarif, aber Rabatt bei Vorlage von Travelcard oder Oystercard.

In der Gegenrichtung hält der 25er-Bus ca. 150 Meter entfernt auf der anderen Straßenseite und fährt direkt ins Zentrum bis zum Oxford Circus. Frequenz in Spitzenzeiten alle 2 Minuten, aber auch die ganze Nacht durch.

Fazit : Dejan ist der perfekte Gastgeber, das Apartment ist wie beschrieben aber noch gemütlicher, der Zugang ist problemlos, die Verkehrslage ist sehr günstig - absolute Empfehlung, hier werde ich jederzeit gerne wieder wohnen wollen ! Vielen Dank Dejan !"
802401,17609151,15/08/2014,12357037,Sophia,"We have just returned from an absolutely stellar stay at Martin's Kensington apartment. The pictures on the airbnb site barely manage to capture how spacious, comfortable, and homey this place is - I was actually quite stunned, being used to smaller accommodations in previous London stays. 
Martin met us at the door and took the time to make sure we were familiar with the apartment's amenities as well as orient us to the neighborhood and local transport. The fridge and kitchen were well stocked with basic foods so we could have some refreshment after the day's travel. There was plenty of storage space for our items (four travelers), plus many things that overall added up for a more pleasant stay - very fast wi-fi, TV with movies to watch in the evenings (very nice when tired and footsore after sightseeing), laundry machine, dishwasher. All in all, the apartment was an extremely comfortable place for my family of four to spend our five days in London. 
The neighborhood is well served by public transport (Shepherd's Bush underground, bus C1/49 among others) and groceries, restaurants, shops and pubs are within a 5-10 minute walk. That said, the apartment itself is on a quiet, tree-lined street of 19th century townhouses - overall a great atmosphere!
I would recommend this most highly for families/small groups who like exploring on their own, save a bit of money by being able to do  a bit of their own cooking, and retreat from the busy-ness of central London after doing some sightseeing. 
I should also add that throughout the booking process, communication with Martin was always prompt, courteous, and informative. An absolute pleasure to deal with. 
Many thanks to Martin for a terrific stay!"

The only slight niggle is that if there are more than two guests and the sofabed is being used there isn't enough comfortable seating in the dining/kitchen area. 
The neighbourhood was OK, a little noisy but didn't keep us awake.  It was a good 10 minute walk to Peckham Rye station which is served by the Overground so the trains aren't as frequent as the Underground - something to keep in mind if you're on a schedule. "

The room itself was cosy and comfortable including ample space to hang clothing items. Breakfast was also available via a self service buffet. Warm and friendly throughout, the hosts certainly justified my claims of good value for only a modest amount of money. Certainly a convenient address for anyone passing through the city. Positive experience overall."

The apartment looks the same as in the photos and it is warm which is good since it was always very cold in the street. Lauren talked a lot with us, she was always worried to see if everything was okay and she also gave us several suggestions of what to do in London and how to get to places faster! It is easy and fast to get to the center of london!
I recommend this room for the next people"

They made us feel comfortable and helped with walking directions, underground travel, and private taxi service. The area is quiet and picturesque and convenient to the London Underground. The room (double with canal view) was clean and had enough space to unpack and relax. The Tower Hill underground station is a mile or so away passing under the Tower Bridge approach and the Tower of London.  The tube ride takes about 30 minutes to central London. There are several restaurants nearby in the St Katherins Docks area."

17917009,638959593,17/07/2020,1446770,Oliver,"We stayed at Simon and Sarah’s for 6 weeks and simply loved it!

There was plenty of room for a family of 2 adults and 2 young kids to settle in and make ourselves at home effortlessly.

The place was very clean when we arrived, has a really homely feel to it and is well appointed so you have everything you need. The rooms have a really good energy and we were very happy hanging out in the living rooms, bedrooms, kitchen or the garden!

The street has a lovely vibe and very neighborly atmosphere. Nearby Mayow park is great (and there are many other parks nearby) and Sydenham High St is a short walk away with everything you need.

Simon and Sarah are very attentive and polite and communicated well throughout our stay - When the kettle broke unexpectedly they ordered a new one, which arrived a day later!

Highly recommended!"

14223219,366316730,02/01/2019,113169060,Blessing Okechukwu,"Shlomi's place is an absolute gem! You have many public transport options: One minute walk puts you on Roman way, where you can hail and ride the 192 bus to Enfield town (5 mins) or Tottenham Hale (about 35 mins). You can catch a train to central from either station. You can also walk 10 mins to Bush Hill Park Rail Station and catch the same train there. There are many retail shops and retail parks within a close walk. A large Morrison's store, Argos, PC Curry's and other shops are in a retail park that is a 7-minute walk away from the house. The house is quiet, very clean and comfortable. Shlomi is a musician and he makes many instruments available for people to play. I loved playing the piano in the living room too! I hope to stay there again!"

Although Shant was not in London during our stay, he was a great host, who was very responsive to messages before and during our stay.

Would highly recommend  this to anyone who wants to stay somewhere in London that is buzzing and eclectic, away from the usual tourist trails but close enough to dip in and out of the hurly burly of central London. It was our first time in islington and actually spent all our weekend wandering around the local areas, eating in the local restaurants and browsing about in the very individual funky shops! It was a delightful experience. the flat , contemporary in style was well equipped and spotless. Good quality linens and towels and finishing touches of a kitchen well stocked with teas and coffees and cereals and fresh milk made it 5 star. The loan of 2 Oyster cards by the owners was a surprise extra that saved us time and hassle organising , and meant we could hop on and off the bus and tube. maps and suggestions of places of local interests and recommended delis and bakeries  were helpful! I cannot find one thing to criticise about the whole experience! The hosts even stored our luggage until our late departure! We will return here again, in fact I can't think of anywhere else in London we would want to stay! Totally delightful and great value!"

The location was perfect - only a few minutes walk to the Shoreditch hustle and bustle (great restaurants and pubs), and very close to the tube (5 minutes to Old Street station). Note, they use a 3rd party to manage the home, which gets a bit buggy. Though all in all, would highly recommend this flat! Be sure to walk 2 minutes to Gloria for the best Italian in town."

Erika a été très accueillante lorsque nous sommes arrivées chez elle.
Il y a tout ce qu'il faut pour passer un court séjour à Londres.
Dommage qu'il n'y ai pas une petite télé dans la chambre (pour les non fêtards). Cela dit, avec tous les kilomètres que nous avons parcourus, nous nous endormions vite !
Comme je l'ai précisé à Erika, il fait un peu froid dans la salle de bain mais avec le petit chauffage d'appoint cela allait mieux.

He also was accommodating about a last-minute change in our arrival time, allowing us to leave our bags early so we could enjoy London for the whole afternoon without luggage. We particularly enjoyed chatting with him over coffee in the morning before we started our day. 
The apartment is a very convenient for central London, the Emirates Stadium and Union Chapel (for concerts, shows). Surprisingly the apartment is very quiet at night - and we had the windows open. In the centre of the apartment buildings are communal garden courtyards where you can sit and soak up the sun. We walked back from Union Chapel (20 min walk) at night past several restaurants but did not dine in the area."

Close to Thames walkway and good restaurants in a quiet neighborhood. Had a great time during our visit to London. Thanks Jeff !
17295589,362361898,26/12/2018,203775991,Kristin,Very clean and stylish apartment and unbeatable location! Great communication from the hosts and easy check-in at the apartment.  We were able to drop our luggage and pick up a key before check-in time and this was a huge help to us to take in some sights before they closed for the holidays.

Alessandro é o tipo de pessoa que faz de tudo para agradar.. nos recebeu muito bem, nos deu um vinho (na correria não deu tempo de tomar rs), explicou tudo sobre a cidade e também nos deu um mapa. Nos sentimos em casa não apenas por sermos compatriotas, mas pela pessoa que o anfitrião se mostrou ser.
O apartamento/quarto são limpos, com uma vista tirar o fôlego. Estação de metro (que te dá acesso a tudo) a 10 minutos a pé do apartamento.. bairro com muito comércio.. pub, supermercado, deli, etc...
O nosso agradecimento não esquecendo do Jordan e a Carol!
Esperamos voltar um dia!"

18459368,469294850,14/06/2019,264505972,Levent,"The studio is an ideal stay when visiting London for business or tourism, a 2 minute work from the underground and overground allowing you to travel across the whole of London. The flat was very clean, there’s cooking appliances which allows you to cook in if you choose too with multiple shops on the street for you to buy bits and bobs. The front door needs to be slightly lifted to open, the real struggle was the studio door which was slightly confusing even though the instructions was on the door (had to get help from neighbors who also struggled). The en-suite shower is spacious, the flat is a steal for the price and the host Camilla’s response time was very satisfactory."
999835,8701340,12/11/2013,3885232,Natalia,"La casa de Alejandro es un gran sitio para quedarse si se viaja acompañado, es amplio, acogedor y el ambiente está muy cuidado.
El metro y el autobús -24h- están muy cerca, y también puedes encontrar supermercados y restaurantes a pocos metros.
La única pega que se le puede poner es que en el anuncio no queda claro que Alejandro y su pareja viven en la misma casa -dice upstairs pero no menciona que se comparte el acceso, la escalera, la cocina,...- y auqnue son una pareja muy discreta y siempre dispuestos a ayudar, nosotros pensábamos que habíamos reservado el ""apartamento entero"" y fue una sorpresa descubrir que no era exactamente así.
En cualquier caso, la experiencia londinense fue fantástica en parte gracias al acogedor alojamiento en stepney!
"
35187786,526623515,09/09/2019,46917072,Rashidah,This place was great for a short stay. The apartment was clean and the basic amenities were provided for laundry and cooking. The co-working space downstairs is a great area to do some work and all the staff are friendly and helpful. It should be noted that it's on the high street and can be very loud at all times of the day and night. There is no lift access so should be noted for anyone with mobility requirements.

We would have appreciated a short introduction to ensure we followed any additional concerns or instructions Pawel had. Unfortunately, Pawel didn't introduce himself, and left right after opening the door (it was a bit unnerving). Many people left great reviews about Pawel, and his space reflected that of a really good host. "

The place is close to many restaurants and convenience stores and it takes around 30 to 40 minutes to get to Central London.

Overall a very pleasant stay."

Verity & her family all gave us a warm welcome (including the delightful Socks - the cat) in their lovely old 4-storey house in Wallington. Ideal location, near to the local shops, & only 11 minutes walk from the family whom I was visiting in nearby Carshalton. Comfortable stay, lovely family, & thoughtful provision of our favourite breakfast cereals. Hope to see you again next year? "

14757410,518823818,27/08/2019,25989776,Florian,"We went there for Notting Hill Carnival so the location is perfect. But that's about it. We had to run the fan the whole night so it was not too hot under the roof (the bed is located over the bathroom) and you could sleep to some extent. In addition, we only had one blanket. The bed is very soft and worn. In the bathroom, the door of the shower cubicle came to me first. At the end we were asked to pay an extra cleaning fee because we supposedly smoked in the room. Everything is very professional and the personal touch is missing."

The house is very comfortable, cleaner and nice. The zone is very calm. And the best for my is that has to 5 minutes walk, a fabulous big park with a lake and ducks, is perfect for trot or bicycling, is so beautiful. 

The house is in zone 3 and the Underground station is a 10 minutes walk. Then 20 minutes in tube to central London. You have a TESCO a 5 minutes to walk. I recomend very much this place. I always will come back."

Brixton is a nice place to stay, well connected to the center, and the room has everything we need: a comfortable bed, just enough space, a private bathroom. Then there is a basic cold breakfast, tea and coffee available in the room and a handy mini fridge.
Finally, nice owners and right price, so we can absolutely recommend this place!"

The room was very comfortable, clean and warm. The bed offered a lovely nights sleep. The best part was the towels that Helen provided were so soft, I couldn't get over it. Would highly recommend staying in Helen's home, it's got really easy access to public transport. It felt like a very safe area and very easy to navigate. Thanks again Helen."

Clean and tidy, the bedrooms are a great size with plenty of bathrooms! (it's so hard to find a house with a lot of bedrooms and more than two bathrooms!). 
Whenever I had a question about something, Nev or Jessica would respond really quickly, which was so helpful. 
Great value for money and a hidden gem!  :)"
25857906,279683448,21/06/2018,193717939,Clark,Location was nice. Apartment was large and spacious. Good for group of 4 looking for cheap but decent stay.

Thanks again for hosting me."
22872611,281593503,25/06/2018,9930711,Joaquín,"Undoubtedly the most value of this place are Luqman and Madeleine's hospitality. They were both very attentive to my needs and I always felt I could reach if I needed something, which was not required (almost everything was present) but enormously appreciated.

The studio is small but well equipped, I had everything I needed and a bit more of what's expected of a host (soap and champoo, for example, and different breakfast meals). As you may know the location is a bit far away from London's center, but it's not that far using the train and it is on very very nice neighborhood, with tons of green and foxes you may say when walking around at night time.

I would recommend this experience if your budget is a bit tight and you don't have problems with living next to a family, it may be a bit noisy but way more private and free than renting a room.

Thanks Luqman and Madeleine for a great time."
40113410,597342471,25/01/2020,128426420,Amaia,"April´s house is very cousy and clean. It´s ideal for resting at night during a holiday. We would have appreciated more material such us towels or invitation to use the house facilities but for our stay the bedroom was ok.
Location is as described, must take a bus for getting from brixton station to the house, otherwise its a long walk. Also, in our case, we had to go to her nearest work station to pick up the flat keys, which was quite an incovenient. But I believe this is not the usual case. 
We enjoyed the stay at her house and recomend considering al the above."

28657276,474482347,23/06/2019,8831304,Jessica,The apartment is extremely cosy and stylish - comfortable bed and great amenities in the kitchen. It’s a perfect location for us because of family nearby but an added bonus being close to Wanstead flats. It feels very safe and secure with a locked gate and door. Charley is an excellent and friendly host. We are planning to stay again soon.
17623327,176709549,31/07/2017,128177794,Alexander,Right in the heart of the city. Conveniently located by the tube and the Thames. Hosts 4 people no problem and has more space than most London apartments

The room was honestly bigger than I expected, as ""cosy"" usually means ""micro.""  The bed was big enough for two, comfy and made up nicely, and the room still had space for a desk and a wardrobe.  The house itself has recently been done up to a very high standard and is in a fantastic location.

Highly recommended!"

1905484,431981762,02/04/2019,149225241,Angus,The flat is excellently located for everything you might want to do in London.  It's ideal for a single or couple to share and is a large one bedroom apartment with substantial kitchen and living area for the location in which you are in. The cleaner coming once a week is a great addition and Chris is an excellent host with very timely responses.
7843912,343604054,01/11/2018,42987212,Pauline,"Kai was a wonderful host, very caring for our wellbeing. We were with our baby and Kai made sure we were good and had all we need for the little one by providing us a  baby folding bed.
 The place is good and well organized and cleaned. Kai takes the time to explain everything, from the flat to the commodities around and how to get where you need, thanks to the welcoming pack sent by email and once in the place, in person.
 Good accommodations and all clean and Fresh. 
Sharing with the 4 other rooms was fine and smooth as the rules are fair and clear.
We recommend Kai airbnb for the hospitality, location and accommodation ;)
Perfect and thank you again!"
28824593,362425514,26/12/2018,30155230,Elaine,"Peter's place is great, and he is also very friendly. He always responses quickly to answer our questions. I would recommend his place to you.  The view from the balcony is fantastic!  You can also see the view from the bedroom.  The place is clean and cozy. It is perfect for 2 people.  The kitchen is also very nice. We just enjoyed our Christmas Day in the house cooking our own food.  The location is quite good as it is in a quiet neighbourhood with supermarket downstairs. It is just literally next to Shadwell DLR station.  It is still convenient to travel around but need to change lines depending on the places that you go; and the this adds up the travel expenses for a bit.  In general, this is a great place to stay."
3764462,62761628,16/02/2016,56631916,Gabe,"Paul and Kal were great hosts!  Paul was there to greet us when we arrived and made us feel quite welcome into his and Kal's home.  The room is as described and there are many options via bus, Underground, Overground to central London.  Kal also gave us options on getting to Stamford Bridge as we were there to see Chelsea play a match. The price of the room is quite fair and an excellent value for being so close to central London (Zone 2).   There were several areas along the bus route from Ladbroke Grove to the house that were under construction which made the bus ride longer than it should be.  We opted to sometimes just walk into Nottinghill (One Hour) which goes through Portobello Market. We took an Uber back to Heathrow upon departure and the cost was about 20 Quid, which saved us time from travel on the bus and Tube. Overall, a great experience."
39127851,573126872,05/12/2019,45443207,Micheál,"I work in Liverpool Street so this apartment is somewhat convenient as I can walk to work, and it is also in walking distance to some of my customers. The surrounding area is lively as it's in Southwark and close to London Bridge. There are shops and pubs nearby if you need to pop out. 
The apartment itself is clean and modern, and also has a comfortable living and dining room where you can relax after a day at work. 
I'll definitely stay here again."

21798514,537318538,28/09/2019,49759830,Ebony,"This is the best Airbnb I’ve ever stayed at. Judith is one of a kind - an excellent host a wonderful person to share a space with. She went above and beyond what I expected—having provided breakfast foods, tidying my room at one point and providing all the privacy I desired. If you’re thinking about booking, do it before you miss out on a comfortable and relaxing experience."

Sebastian is very accommodating, and provided thoughtful responses throughout our stay - even arranging for the home to be cleaned during our stay. The garden is spectacular - a real sanctuary in London.

The mattress was not very comfortable, and there is not as much light as portrayed in the photos. That being said, our overall experience was very positive and we would be more than delighted to stay there again."
11655209,113580830,13/11/2016,56387764,Charlotte,I stayed at Rachel's with my boyfriend and we had a lovely stay. Rachel met us at the flat to give us the keys and she was very accommodating to our needs. The location was perfect with only a ten minute walk to elephant and castle station and a tesco express just round the corner which was convenient. The flat was extremely clean and very quiet. The only thing we found bad was that the communal area in the block of flats only had a light switch at the bottom of the stairs and was incredibly dark and dangerous going out at night. Apart from that our stay was perfect. Thank you Rachel for being a great host. 
12788220,167002099,05/07/2017,3185561,Anzela,Sandy was very easy to communicate with and her property was well appointed with everything you might need for a stay away from home. The small lift was useful in bringing up heavy luggage. The location was very close to the underground and the station was just a few stops from many transfer points to other lines. We enjoyed being close to public transport and small markets and restaurants yet having the peace a quiet in the flat even with the windows open.

There's evidence of damp in the bedroom but the bed was comfortable.  I arrived late and Florian was very accommodating.
5366295,116749568,03/12/2016,104800261,Cheng,"Many thanks to LDG team and great apartment, we do really had a wonderful time staying in the apartment. The check-in process went easily and smoothly. The perfect location just 5 minutes walk to Oxford Circus station means that you can walk to shopping at great stores; walk to many landmarks and attractions; easily get to rail stations. The apartment is extremely clean with updated appliances just as described on the website. I think it's the best place to start your journey in London!I wish to live in this apartment when I visit London next time! 

感谢LDG团队和他们的公寓,使我们在伦敦留下了难忘的回忆｡Check-in过程简单方便｡5分钟即可到达牛津街地铁站,意味着你可以走路去各大百货购物;走路抵达诸多景点;快捷方便的抵达各个火车站｡公寓非常干净并装配了全新的设施,和网站上的描述十分一致｡这里绝对是您开启伦敦之行最好的地方!如果将来还能来伦敦,我仍然会选择住在这里!"

13455562,132999228,20/02/2017,101026727,Élise,"Both Alex and Brian were great hosts! It was lovely to meet them. Brian checked us in when we arrived and he made sure we settled in well. The house itself was beautiful, honestly one of the nicest houses I've stayed in. The room me and my boyfriend stayed looked exactly like the photos; even better to be honest. The house and of course the room itself was very clean, cozy and comfortable. The weather was nice during our stay so we got to enjoy our complimentary breakfast outside their beautiful garden. Although the house is in Zone 4, traveling was quite easy as there were about 3 stations all 10 minutes away from the house by walking. You can get to central London within 20-30 mins. Will definitely stay there again next time I come back to London! 100% recommended. Had no problems, everything was perfect. "

12877982,360373590,20/12/2018,21931019,Leonie,"Caroline's place is extraordinarily nice. The room is big and looks exactly like the pictures. The bed is super comfortable and Caroline and her daughter were super friendly and helpful. 
The room was a little bit cold but it has a functioning fireplace that I was allowed to use to heat the room which worked perfectly! Everything was really uncomplicated. The Tube-station is a 10 min walk away and there are lots of restaurants, cafés and shops in the surrounding area. 
I couldn't have wished for a better place to stay in London!"

13662999,123237984,28/12/2016,3046692,Steven 'Baggy',"We were looking for a high quality, secluded, clean place near to transport to our family who live in north west London for xmas. We were attracted because this studio looked modern, clean and well located & equipped. We did not want one of those ""If only it had..."" experiences again.
Pleased to say that this place was exactly as advertised with exceptional finish to the decoration reminiscent of a 5 star hotel,  spotless everywhere with a great power shower. It's like a secluded little cottage once you close the doors with a magical view of stars through the roof adding to its charm. It's actually very small but so well designed that even if you have a couple kids who need to crash for a day or two it has a sofabed and TV in the living room allowing them to have some privacy while you stay in the main bedroom (also with TV). The fully equipped kitchen and local supermarkets mean that you do not have to eat out unless you choose to in which case there are some award winning restaurants nearby. All in all a first class place that I would recommend even if it means stretching your budget."
33710688,540433510,03/10/2019,180473022,Zillur,"Nice, clean, quiet and secure place to live, with nearby commuting facility. Milda is a very caring and responsive host."

Good location and easy transport. Self check in very easy. Lots of places to eat or buy food. Chose this place for closeness to Brick Lane, Whitechapel Art gallery, Dennis Severs house."
23374319,337457690,16/10/2018,5838985,James And Monica,A warm bed if you need a place close to King's Cross. Although heavy traffic was right outside if the window is closed you can barely hear it. Lots of restaurants in the area. The bathroom might be off putting to some.
2163914,32308307,17/05/2015,23495546,Sarah,"We had a fantastic stay in Naresh's apartment. The location was fantastic - just near Oxford st and Tottenham Court road station. Loads of shops, restaurants and bars nearby. Naresh was very welcoming - we met him nearby and he showed us around the flat and he had left us milk, soft drink, tea, coffee, biscuits etc. We would definitely stay here again on our next visit to London!"
6616593,480752391,03/07/2019,5552813,Annabel,"A value room in a good location, literally 5 mins from the main Wembley venues. Shared facilities so be prepared. Great if you are 2 or 3 going to an event locally and just want to crash, easy check in and good comms from the owners."

‘’Elegante y cómodo alojamiento, en un tranquilo lugar, con la hospitalidad inmejorable de su propietaria Julia. 
Qué más se puede pedir en un AirBnB dentro de las áreas más emblemáticas de Londres, a 3 cuadras del área turística..desde los puentes en el Río Támesis, como al Palacio de Buckingham y sus hermosos parques, el Parlamento con su Torre Elizabeth “el Big Ben”.

Gracias por todo Julia, pasé 7 días muy relajados en tu bella casa.’’"

12621887,134649135,28/02/2017,50971648,Antonia,"Die Unterkunft hat eine tolle Lage: nah genug um schnell im Zentrum zu sein und eine gute Anbindung zu U-Bahn-Stationen. Sie liegt in einer ruhigen Strasse. 
Die Gastgeber waren bezüglich des Check-In sehr flexibel, so konnten wir Dank der Putzdame, die uns aufgemacht hat, schon früher in das Apartment und uns erst einmal ausruhen. Das Zimmer ist klein, aber beinhaltet alles was man braucht. Das Bett ist sehr gemütlich und sauber, ideal für ein Pärchen, da es nur eine Decke gab. Leider war der Rest nicht so sauber wie erwartet (und wie beschrieben). Die Regale und der Boden waren ziemlich staubig und die Toilette hat etwas gestunken. Wir haben uns dennoch sehr wohl gefühlt und die Unterkunft ist alles was man braucht, wenn man den ganzen Tag in London unterwegs ist."

Jo & Jake are truly fantastic hosts, super communicative, friendly and accommodating. The feel of the whole place was so right, I’m going to miss not only the apartment but also the neighborhood! So many cute cafes, bars and shops, and it’s riiiight next to the park! Couldn’t recommend this place more  Until next time :)"
4670636,28882718,31/03/2015,1279329,Karen,"We loved our stay here! The bedroom was huge and the flat had so much charm. The kitchen was large and well equipped. We didn't meet Claire since she was out of town but she communicated about our arrival and checked in with us to make sure all was well. The guys who live in the flat were so friendly!

Brixton is a cool area and the apartment is within easy walking distance to two tube stops and a grocery store."

It is an easy walk to the East Putney tube station.  Also there are several restaurants and pubs there.  There is also a small Sainsburys and Waitrose (grocery stores) so it was easy to grab food on the way home from a day of sightseeing.

The only things to be aware of is that stairs to the bedroom on the top floor are quite steep.  So if you have issues with stairs it might not be the place for you.  Also there is no sitting area.

But is a perfect for a family of four."

The flat was just right for us, located in a great area with lots of public transport and yet off the main road so was very quite. The flat was clean and had everything ready for us, including having the sofa bed out for us, since we checked in really late. Located off the main street with lots of options to buy groceries and fresh fruits and veg for breakfast etc so that you can prepare your own meal in the flat. Communication with Chloe was clear and quick from the get go. I highly recommend Chloe's place for a small family and / or 2-3  friends."
2862816,162269852,20/06/2017,1264457,Kim,"I loved staying at Laura's.  The room is quiet, clean, comfortable, and spacious.  The apartment is very close to buses that run into the city, or to Highgate.  Hampstead Heath is at the back door, and is wonderful to explore.  Highgate Village and Cemetery arejust up the hill, easily accessible by bus or by walking.  Staying here was an excellent choice for being close to the city, yet having the serenity of Hampstead Heath nearby.  Laura is a warm and friendly host.  I will stay here again."

We love east London so the position just off Brick Lane and a few minutes away from the flower market was ideal.

Overall it was so comfortable and exactly what we needed for a week.   Will definitely book again for our next trip to London! "
5432529,70395491,17/04/2016,56368828,Rozenn,I was very pleased to stay at ThamesRiverFront. We were very well welcomed. The flat is spacious and very comfortable with everything needed.

2569427,110417178,26/10/2016,44317128,Daphne,"Danny was an amazing host even though we haven't met him personally. However, we received our key without any trouble since his housekeeper was there to welcome us at our arrival. All in all, the place is better than any hotel room if slightly overpriced. Our stay was pleasant because the flat is very central but what needs to be pointed out is that it's located on the lower ground. This has been mentioned in previous reviews but I want to make this clear once again especially since the stairs are a nightmare. I travelled with my mother (who is close to her 70s) and the first day she already hit her head so that it would bother her for the days to come. This flat is not suited for anyone who has issues with mobility which should be mentioned in the description. Even to me it was quite the struggle to walk the stairs up and down, not to mention to walk the stairs with luggage. Furthermore, the light doesn't turn on until you have already walked down the stairs which makes it quite dangerous to walk them at night since the street is only dimly lit."

Dank Irene konnten wir unser Gepäck schon mittags abstellen und sofort weiter fahren. Das ganze Haus ist super sauber.  Handtücher, Duschgel und Haarwäsche ist vorhanden. Zum Frühstück stehen Kaffee, Tee, Milch, Toast und Marmelade bereit. Wenn man das Zimmer nur zum Schlafen braucht, ist es auch für 4 Personen ok. Bedingt durch die Nähe zum Flughafen, sind die Flugzeuge deutlich zu hören. Nachts ist allerdings Flugpause. Wir hatte eine tolle Zeit in London. Vielen Dank Irene!"

The rooms were a good size, the kitchen, a bit small, but had all the necessary items, it even had a microwave and a dishwasher. All cooking utilities also available.
The beds were clean and comfortable and the main bedroom had en en suite.

The house does have a more lived in feel than other places we have stayed and was not as clean or light as we would have liked. Note that the key collection and return is a 10min walk from the house and involves a detour if you are coming to or from Angel."

The only thing I could say negative about this place was no microwave, otherwise the beds were lovely and it was very quiet at night!
We will be back!
Thanks Amanda!

 The location is excellent you are close to restaurants, bars and local transport . 
Kiki is a great host and communicates very quickly when you contact her . The check in and out was seamless . I would definitely highly recommend it."

529070,20801579,05/10/2014,10085232,Yvonne,"What a treasure to come across in one of those beautiful quiet leafy back streets of Belsize Park, just a few minutes' walk from the tube station, and then a short ride into the centre of London.  AND not all that far from the wonderful urban 'wilderness' of Hampstead Heath! 
What I assumed would be a single bedroom turned out to be part of a small and delightful  flat!  With its own entrance, large bright bathroom, lovely living room, and even my own kitchen for those nights when I felt like giving London restaurants a miss.  No shortage of great food shops and mini-markets in Belsize Park and Belsize Village nearby.  
Chris' office was part of 'my' flat, but he kept such a low profile I hardly even knew he was there - and he was a most kind and considerate host, cheerful and welcoming: he even looked up some film training courses for me in Edinburgh, where I live, after we discussed our common work in documentary film.  
I would definitely recommend staying with Chris and Renata  to visitors passing through London, and I look forward to staying there again myself!"

My room was ready 4 hours before the check-in time, which was much appreciated. The place is beautiful and clean. The ""breakfast corner"" was a lifesaver.

My husband and I had never done a stay that wasn’t a private apartment, we’d now do it again hoping all are so great!

The extra bathroom is a real plus, especially if you are a couple of guests. 

The house is located just off Chalk Farm Station and the Nothern Line connects you well to London.

Geraldine's kitchen is super well equipped. You'll find all crockery and cutlery to prepare breakfast/dinner. 

And if you're fortunate to have some sunny spells during your visit, you can enjoy her beautiful little garden. 

We rate Geraldine (Phone number hidden by Airbnb) % recommended and we're happy to return!"

The house is as delightful as it appears in the photos and is very well located, on a street that is quiet and yet right by Westfeild and the tube. The bed is comfy and the house is nicely furnished and very clean. Bella is such a lovely person and she went out of her way to make everything run smoothly for us. For instance, there was a small issue where the heating could not be switched on because the thermostat was in one of the locked rooms - Bella was out of town so could not attend, but as soon as we contacted her she got right on the case and organised a portable heater for us which did the job just fine. Thank you for being a great host Bella. We would certainly stay again!"

The location is zone 2 and 15 mins walk to Victoria and picidilly line or a 5 min bus journey, which means you can be in Oxford street in 30 minutes door to door. The neighbourhood is also fun to explore with a newly opened wetlands  a short walk away or the abundance of cafes on church street, unless you want to walk a bit further to the trendy Dalston area or onto Shorditch. 
We can't wait to return!"

The house is quiet!! Very important to me. The double bed was very comfy and the sheets were soft. The house is split into guest rooms and reminds me of a boarding house of the bygone Era. The other tenants are friendly and very easy to be around. All in all I likes it. Nice area. Five minutes to Stockwell and a nice walk to the house. I highly recommended Mark and I will probably be booking him again as I may have another double booking. :)"

Die Wohnung befindet sich mit einer Fahrzeit von 30 Minuten mit den öffentlichen Verkehrsmitteln sehr zentral in ruhiger Lage, was den Ausgleich zu der pulsierenden Stadt definitiv gibt. Das Zimmer entspricht genau der Beschreibung und bietet eine große Staufläche. Das Doppelbett ist sehr bequem für einen optimalen Schlaf. Die beiden sind sehr herzlich und offen, so konnten wir uns frei und selbstverständlich in der Wohnung bewegen und auch die Küche und das Bad mitbenutzen. Neben einer sehr informativen Wegbeschreibung im Vorfeld der Reise durch eine kleine Infomappe von den beiden fanden wir im Zimmer weitere Pläne, Bücher und Flyer. Es war ein rundum schöner, angenehmer und komfortabler Aufenthalt bei den Beiden. Wir werden gerne wieder kommen sollten wir in London sein und die Unterkunft gerne weiterempfehlen! "

We had full privacy and quiet in our en-suite up the top of a spiral staircase at the front end of the house.  However, Farida was available, warm and a source of information when ever needed.  The cottage was created from the old gatehouse of the spa that originally drew people to Hampstead.  It is across from the common garden, a short few blocks from the Heath and near to good shops, pubs, restaurants and the tube.  We adored experiencing village life while having such ready access to London. 
Farida’s will definitely always  be our landing place in Hampstead."

Not luxurious but comfortable and homely. The kitchen was well equipped which I liked as I stayed we stayed in and cooked. All the basics were provided which is definitely not always what I have found in the many Airbnb places I have stayed in. So plenty of toilet paper, washing up liquid, the basics that are annoying to have to buy just for a few days. It was tricky to find the keys when I got there. I was dropped at the door with all my bags and the keys were around the corner on a different road so I had to drag my bags there which was a bit frustrating especially as I didn't know where I was going! Overall a good place to stay."

The place looked exactly how it did in the photos and it was truly as spacious as it looked. The listing is located in a residential neighborhood a little further out from central London, but that wasn't a negative in our book because it allowed us to stay clear of loud streets and a rowdy atmosphere. The Queen's Park tube station is within walking distance anyway, and just a few stops from Piccadilly Circus and other central areas. All in all, a great place that I highly recommend, especially to visitors to London who are looking to stay for a few nights. Thanks for everything, Paula!"

Could have easily slept as many as 8 (with the extra beds). 11 is pushing it unless members of the group are couples or have no issue sharing a double bed. It's very easy to get anywhere in London via bus or tube from the apartment and the Islington neighborhood is very quaint and peaceful. Owen gave us some great recommendations for places to eat as well. However, the place wasn't the cleanest I've ever seen and could've used a couple more amenities such as bath soap. Also, we happened to visit on one of the hottest weekends of the year, but the apartment is not equipped with air conditioning (as is common in London) and has only one bedroom fan. Any other time of year that would not have been an issue, but something to consider. Additionally, the check-in and check-out time were strict and there was nowhere to store our luggage which was a bit of an inconvenience for us as we came in early on the first day and left late on the last day.

Jasmine and Freddie were super helpful and quick to communicate, and gave detailed instructions for taking a bus and walking the 8-ish minutes to their house. I would stay here again."
4050186,40314683,30/07/2015,28549360,Maria,Seema is an excellent host.  She made my family feel very welcome - she was just a  phone call away and she was very accommodating to any requests!  The description provided of the flat was very accurate.  The decor was welcoming and everything we needed was there.  We loved the area as there were plenty of attractions nearby for my young daughter.  The flat was located very conveniently within walking distance to shopping and both the train and tube stations.  It only takes 15 minutes to get to Waterloo!  I will definitely recommend Seema's flat!

1475103,38756319,18/07/2015,36994641,Xan,"I recently stayed at Fara's flat while in London for just over a week on business. The flat was neat and tidy, and appeared as per the photos with the listing. The location was extremely convenient and it was an excellent base for my trip. Fara kindly allowed me to check in an hour earlier than the advertised time, and provided a thorough run down of the flat, amenities and expectations. 

This was my first time using Airbnb and I had thought that all charges would be processed through the website. Fara advised me on check in that she would charge an additional £50 cleaning fee, which I hadn't noticed in the listing. I felt that this was excessive given the size of the space, and that friends living in the area noted that they had cleaners come in for less than £30 for similar spaces, but as I had overlooked the note in the listing, I paid the amount. 

The water in the shower was extremely hot while I was there, to the point that I was unable to stay under long enough to wash my hair. I contacted Fara and she responded quickly, which was appreciated. Fara noted that it was not possible to get cold water or cooler water through the shower, and that she felt that she had left it set at a 'temperate' level. Fara offered to come two days later to change the temperature, but as I didn't want to spend time fiddling with it while there, and Fara seemed a little annoyed about it, I said not to worry. This may have just been a misunderstanding, but is something to take note of. 

Other than that, there were no issues, and things went smoothly. Having said that. I will likely look for alternate accommodation next time I am in London. "

The location is great, <10 minute stroll to Stamford Brook (District Line) tube, Chiswick High Street, and more.  The studio flat is truly private and self-contained, part of a house on a very quiet residential road.   The flat itself has everything you need:  washer, efficient kitchen (oven, hob, toaster, kettle, microwave), and a lovely modern bath with walk-in rain shower.  The bed is comfy,  TV great, and plenty of hanging space for clothes.

Communication with our hosts was excellent,  and they kindly arranged early access for us as we were arriving early with luggage to manage.   We arrived to find a loaf of fresh baked bread on the table,  and the fridge was stocked with necessities to get us started. How nice!  Bridget invited us over for drinks and a lively chat.  A full set of instructions was left for us, including local points of interest, other amenities to be found in the flat, how to access Wi-fi, really everything you would need to know to make the most of your stay.

8933087,244966536,20/03/2018,175962093,Stefan,"Salwa’s Home - situated in Little Venice London Paddington – is more than an Airbnb. 

There’s a good reason why Airbnb exist opposed to your standard impersonal hotel experience. 
This being only my second stay at Airbnb home; I cannot be more convinced to prefer it over a hotel stay. Although, maybe it was just my luck and good fortune to book my stay at Salwa’s place. For what is a home without a hostess that understands the needs of travellers. Be it couples, singles, business men or the odd stray wonderer. 

In general people, and in this setting hosts - that accept complete strangers; open their hearts, hear their story, listen and not judge, only give advice when asked. Those persons in life, should be highly valued for the truly special humans they are. Certainly, when they expose themselves by offering you the temporary shelter and safety of their home. Securing you to feel it like your home base. These people all across the world should always be treated with the greatest respect.

Salwa is such a lovely person, of whom I am so fortunate to have got to know. She welcomed me into her home which is; clean, comfortable with all the facilities you need. The Rain Shower is Divine! The lay out of her house is functional with access to kitchen where you can (if you wish) make your own coffee/tea or even prepare meal using ingredients Salwa offered me to use free of charge.

Her house is situated a 10 minute walk away by the canal to Paddington station and even closer to Royal Oak underground which made me flexible in my ways – fore with I should to mention in general Little Venice is a beautiful part of town. Can’t wait to get back in the Spring Time.

It was with regret, I had to continue my travels and move on because I could have stayed longer than the 5 days I did. Nevertheless, Salwa has come to be my friend and I recommend everyone wishing to have a great place to stay in London – to consider and respect the hospitality Salwa so kindly offers."

20269134,534168916,22/09/2019,120435158,Cassandra Anne,"Adam and Johanna have been wonderful hosts and they are truly invested in making sure their guests are comfortable. Upon arrival, we were welcomed with chocolates and warm hospitality, despite arriving late at night. Their place is calm and quiet, and we rested well every day we were there. They provided tailored suggestions to local gems we wouldn’t otherwise know about from online searching. They were also very respectful of our privacy and were very understanding in all aspects. We felt like it was as if we were staying with old friends.

Their place is situated at a golden location where supermarkets (Sainsbury's and Tesco), top-rated bakeries/cafés (Dominique Ansel’s, GAIL’s), friendly local pubs (Constitution, The Marquis of Westminster), and even the best Fish and Chips in the neighborhood (Fresh) were all within a 5 mins walking distance.

It only takes less than 10 minutes to walk to Victoria station, which by itself is an interchange station that serves 3 major Tube lines (District/Circle/Victoria), Gatwick Express, Southern Railways and many buses; hence getting around London is not a problem. If you are up to walking further, much of London’s major museums and buildings of interest are also within 15-20 minutes walk of the area. Our stay was around mid-September of which a majority of days were sunny; we skipped the Tube and walked to the Science Museum, Imperial War Museum, Churchill War Rooms and passed by the Buckingham Palace through St James’ Park with ease.

Not only will I be booking their place again for my next visit; It is definitely one I will send friends and family over to whenever they visit London. I would recommend their Pimlico Place for couples seeking a relaxing visit, for international students seeking a quiet place to study for external papers, or for anyone wanting to learn about London through the eyes of friends."

Sarah is quick to respond to emails and was available during our stay to help out but we didn't need to. A welcome package with details about the area, house rules/tips and local restaurant flyers was a nice touch. 

Convenient location for tube and train, many restaurants on your doorstep and great kitchen and deck area for entertaining at home. Bedrooms are spacious and comfortable and all the bathrooms are done to a high spec - great water pressure! 

It was a real treat to spend time in this Victorian home with all the modern conveniences you want but retaining the beautiful traditional features of a home from this era.

38919342,592534488,13/01/2020,301022232,Peter,"Really enjoyed our stay. A nice apartment with everything we needed. About a 7 minute walk to Wandsworth Common Station, 15mins to either Clapham Junction or Clapham South. Also the 319 bus to Clapham Junction was only a 3 minute walk away.
The apartment was ideal for a family of 4 or 2 couples (2 single beds in the downstairs bedroom). Bathrooms adjacent to both bedrooms. It was very warm and cosy, we didn't need to use the gas fire! Would recommend for a stay away from the hustle and bustle of Central London but it is still easily accessible when you need to go in. Enjoy strolling around the Commons, Clapham and Wandsworth both close by, visiting the local pubs and cafes.
Thanks again!"

1548874,37474621,07/07/2015,31303571,Claudia,I had two guests of mine staying at Marco's flat for 5 days. Marco was extremely good and keeping in contact and answered all our queries. He sent us a very detailed file with all the instructions for the flat. He consistently checked in with us to ensure the guests had a good stay. The flat is very pretty and my guests had an excellent stay. Highly recommended.

354003,16053013,21/07/2014,11660945,Roisin,"Travelling to London for the first time with our two little boys, we were a little nervous about how it would work out.  But we needn't have worried – we thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Eleonor's apartment.  The apartment had everything required for our weekend and ample space – my husband, me and the boys (aged 3 and 18 months) stayed.  Eleonor was readily contactable and answered any queries we had before arrival.  Arrangements for check in and out were excellent - extremely hassle free.  The location of the apartment was first class - easy access from Earl's Court tube station, supermarket stores within walking distance, and beautiful walks to be had in and around the area.  The lift also meant good access with prams and suit cases, which was great. There are a few steps from the street to gain access to the building but we were able to lift the prams up these and found it manageable.

The only thing I would say is that with two toddlers we were extra vigilant about the piano.  Our boys didn't realise, and we didn't point out, that it was a piano, but it might be something to bear in mind if staying with little ones.

We would definitely recommend the apartment... and thank you Eleonor for such a lovely stay.

It was indeed very clean and well maintained for his guests, so kudos to that! He even had lots of amenities provided for us, and even had the thought to get us some bread/ food in case we ever do get hungry. I had an issue with the shower water flow towards the end of the trip and was taken aback by how it happened twice that I had to trouble Martin to fix it for me. But thank goodness he was very helpful and got it working by the time we came home in the evening. Overall, experience was great and would definitely recommend this place with an excellent location to my friends next time! "

We were met by her friend who introduced us to the apartment which really does look like the pictures. The location suited our needs being very comfortable and quiet with close access to buses and Bermondsy underground. As per our desires we were left to ourselves and myself and my boys enjoyed our stay in this lovely apartment.

15531309,434730944,08/04/2019,80458862,Bill,Adrian’s flat is very handy for travellers. Only a few stops on underground from Kings Cross. Very well appointed with very comfortable beds. Amazingly quiet while being on a main road. A great area for bars and restaurants. Something for everyone. Adrian responds quickly to any queries. Very happy to go back again.

The flat is nicely decorated and clean, even in January it was nice to go to the roof to have some fresh air and views. Parsons Green is also a very nice area. Both the buses and the underground worked well for the directions we needed to use. Cafes and bakeries in the neighborhood were nice too. The only problem we had was getting a key. "

It had all the amenities that we needed during our stay and Marti was very quick with responses to any questions we had."
35457445,483119639,07/07/2019,207532211,Sara,"Emeka and Roseanne's home provided me with a good place to stay whilst working in the area. The shared kitchen had all the amenities I required, the room was clean with a comfortable single bed and a fridge - useful in London summertime - the room was downstairs so the windows could only be open when you were in so sometimes the room felt a little stuffy, easily combatted by providing a fan for future guests. The downstairs bathroom was a little tired, perfectly functioning, just needed a good scrub. 
Overall good value for money if you're working in the area and have a car - and on your days off transport into central London is a 15 min walk, a bus and a tube so it's doable but not the easiest.
Just a handful of small alterations it would make it great."
1605623,317661017,02/09/2018,12949650,Елена,"RUS: Оставляю очень искренний теплый отзыв о Сицилии. Это было лучшее место для остановки: очень чисто,  уютно и красиво. Это прекрасный дом. Комната на 3 этаже, ванная комната рядом. Сицилия оставила для нас в комнате: чай, кофе, конфеты, приятные мелочи, фрукты, ванные принадлежности. Даже зонтик и переходники, которые очень пригодились! 
О плюсах:
- отлично работающий интернет
- чистый, тихий, красивый район Лондона
- остановка в 3 минутах ходьбы (прямая дорога до Кинг Кросса, 73 автобус)
- магазинчики в пешей доступности
- возможность пользоваться кухней на 2 этаже тоже
- уборка комнаты
- очень доброжелательная хозяйка   

Небольшой минус:  это не центр, поэтому добираться 55-60 минут до главных достопримечательностей. Но для туриста: утром вышел и только вечером зашел обратно, это перестает быть проблемой. 
Спасибо Сицилия! Обнимаю!

ENG:  I want to leave very sincere warm comment about Сecilia. It was the best place for a stop: very cleanly, very comfortably and beautifully. It is the beautiful house. The room on the 3rd floor, a bathroom near at room. Cecilia has left for us in the room: tea, coffee, candies pleasant to a trifle, fruit, bath accessories. Even an umbrella and adapters which very much were useful! 
About pluses:
- perfectly working Internet
- clean, quiet, beautiful district of London
- a stop in 3 minutes on foot (the streight way to King's Cross Station, the bus 73)
- little shops within walking distance
- an opportunity to use kitchen on the 2nd floor too
- cleaning of the room
- very friendly hostess

Small minus: it is not the center, so it is 55-60 minutes to  the main sights. But for the tourist: in the morning I left and only I have come back in the evening, it stops being a problem.

Thanks Cecilia!"
21116139,477357322,28/06/2019,17967809,Alexandra,"Very nice studio well organized and clean. Private and easy access with excellent information provided by Vincent. The minus is the poor acoustic isolation with the main house (probably from the door connecting main house and studio) and so you live with the owner rythme of life (wake up call, movie, cooking and discussion...)."
27477279,419096634,03/03/2019,71931842,Julia,"Natalie & Mark were very welcoming and friendly! Their house is in an excellent location, only a few minutes walk from Clapham Common tube station. Restaurants, pubs and shops are seconds away by foot as well. The bedroom itself was spacious, had a TV, comfortable bed, and an easily accessible (nice!) clean bathroom. All in all, I would recommend this for your London stay and would definitely return to this Airbnb on a future trip. Only good things to say. Thank You both!"

18233621,273770451,07/06/2018,84828862,Chenzi,"[HIGHLY RECOMMENDED] To be honest, the main reason I picked this place is because I love the room photos, and the house looks just the same as on the photos. What's more important is the hosts are super nice, casual and friendly, makes you feel like home. The location is great, very convenient to travel around. I can go on and on and on...

However our flat was the basement flat so absolutely no view or natural light, but that darkness is nice to sleep longer in the morning. The walls are a little thin too and we heard the neighbors but it was not at problematic times so that was ok. Overall it is a good value bc the neighborhood is really nice for tourism."
15968673,152226629,15/05/2017,125450501,Shruti,"Rosa's place was very well located, very close to Bermondsey Street and the London Bridge tube station. The room was very clean and Rosa and her husband were very friendly.

However, it didn't seem like we could access the kitchen, I felt very awkward knocking on the lounge door in order to get some water, as it was kept closed most of the times.

Rosa could really do with installing a keysafe or another way of handing the keys to future guests as its not always possible for the hosts to be available when guests want to check in and this was a problem for us on both occasions we stayed here. We had to hurry to get to the place to obtain the keys both times."

any downsides? perhaps for me - a rather soft bed, but that’s just personal to me. Also bear in mind, it is professionally run, when they say check out is 11 - they mean just that. 

Also i’m not a huge fan of digital key check ins - again that’s just me. 

these are minor issues though as overall:

It’s a great place to stay - actually excellent value for money. Would recommend highly. 

They could easily charge more - per night, and achieve it it, no problem. I’d say it was a bargain. 

Thank you!"

12330363,357935475,12/12/2018,17285972,Anna,"Peter's place is centrally located, and quiet, despite the proximity to many local attractions.  Peter was also very responsive to any inquiries.  Overall, we enjoyed our stay.  The place was a bit smaller than expected, and there is a two-burner cooktop in lieu of a stove, but we made the proper adjustments and overall had a positive experience."

37624863,543761999,08/10/2019,102655288,Mouna,"Vanda’s house is a little flat on the front of her house. It’s nicely decorated, though the kitchen and bathroom can be a little pokey for two- but I’m sure for one person the flat would feel cosy and perfect for a convenient stay near the airport. 
There was a small convention oven which came in handy for a few nights when we didn’t want to go out for dinner- though I would recommend Vanda puts it down on the bench top as it is currently positioned high above average head height and as a result pulling boiling food onto yourself is a definite possibility.

Thee was a fair amount of foot traffic early in the morning in the shared walkway and lots of slamming doors which was frustrating. Using the key to close the door would stop the noise of the door. Other than this we had a lovely stay, Vanda was quick to help and respond to questions.
Thanks Vanda!"
14914050,205469815,22/10/2017,4094288,Leonide,"The flat is in basement and staircase is narrow but owner is very kind to help with the luggage bag else I couldn’t even bring down my big luggage bag. Room is considered clean but no lock. Overall house wise is okay but not super neat kind. The location is not really near to tube, nearest is Oxford circus, 10 min walk. The price is worth only for the location. But owner is very kind in answering all my questions."

There are many books of historical value.  The bedding is very comfortable!  The smart home system is very good!  The host is very very nice!  Can provide us with all possible help.

4328546,534954007,23/09/2019,19060847,Clare,"Nicholas’s Marylebone flat was the perfect place for our time in London. The location is ideal- no more than a 5 minute walk to the tube and a short ride to the Paddington station. The flat is quirky, which we loved! The bed was comfortable, there’s a lot of natural light. The kitchen is well suited for small meals, we had breakfast there each morning which was lovely, but didn’t use it any further than that. The bedroom has a skylight that has a curtain you can place over it to block the light in the morning however my husband and I both use sleep masks so that’s wasn’t an issue for us. The bedroom could be a little noisy as it’s close to the street, but again, it wasn’t an issue for us because we use a white noise sleep machine at night! Nicholas provides a fan in each room and a hairdryer which was a HUGE delight for me! He was very easy to communicate with, we had no trouble getting in or checking out of the place. Would highly recommend and we would stay again upon return to London! Thank you!!"
236956,18680156,30/08/2014,3634272,Kalli,"Great room! Exactly as advertised, clean and comfortable - good information to find the apartment. Can highly recommend both Donovan & the room!"

38992672,612782697,01/03/2020,109819846,Linda,"The room was okay but a little bit to expensive for what you get. In the house stayed other Airbnb guest so the atmosphere was more like in a hostel. 
But still it is a good place to stay for one or two nights. 
The communication with Tennessee was really good and uncomplicated. 
And the location is also really good!"
1488173,23336373,29/11/2014,8069426,Gabriel,Imogen was a lovely host and very helpful with directions to and about the city. Place was quiet yet accessible to one of the major subway interchanges that made for very easy travel. BRILLIANT!

890398,270431976,29/05/2018,28559682,Kim,"Paula’s place is cute and low key and had everything I needed for a short trip. The location is very central and about a 10 minute walk to train stations in either direction.

I met Paula ahead of check-in to drop my bags in the hallway and she was super friendly and accommodating. I checked in with Matthew a few hours later, who was also very upbeat and welcoming and had already moved my bags to the room.

This is a dorm-style apartment so there are other rooms and then a couple of shared bathrooms but I never crossed paths with other guests and there was never a wait for the bathroom. Also there is a sink in the room for extra convenience. I’d suggest packing some easy shoes to slip on if you need to go down the stairs to use the toilet."
11031215,423473922,14/03/2019,42583073,Isabell,"We had a really nice stay. The place is located close to bus station, cafe, restaurants, grocery etc and the neighborhood is very nice and quiet. It has a temperature control system to keep the whole place warm which was a huge plus for me as I get cold easily. Overall a very nice stay, thanks James!"
31306678,590011590,07/01/2020,290790076,Calvin,"Lovely little spot with a nice place to step out the window. The surrounding area has two nice nearby pubs (although expensive) - The Mitre and The Swan, and some nice scenery. The proximity to Hyde Park, Lancaster Gate Station, and a bus stop is really great too. The bedding pictured was not what was included, it was just two pillows, and the two blankets and the bedsheet, so those who like lots of head support may find themselves wanting, but for us it was fine and we didn't notice until reviewing the pictures later. The bathroom was also slightly renovated, and I actually liked the new bathroom so it wasn't a problem at all. The place was very cosy, so keep that in mind. Also, those that want to cook should be aware that the supplies aren't top notch - just a hotplate and toaster oven, no spices or salt - but a creative chef can make do and everything was crystal clean."
12252465,163679056,25/06/2017,14525844,Freja,"Lovely place to stay with only a short distance to Greenwich. Supermarket close by and a pub on the corner.

The apartment has everything you'll need for your stay. Though there are only a few interactions with other guests, not ideal then if you are looking for a more cosy place for longer stay.
Still recommend and perfect for short stay. I stayed about a month and it was very nice."

17487071,137916077,18/03/2017,43211020,Yvette,"Because I got lost in London and the location was further away than I thought I arrived quite later in the evening than I planned, then left early since I only booked one night before I left town so I didn't get a 'full' experience. Gloria was super sweet and hospitable and has a lovely home. I appreciate that each room has a lock and key and there is a small breakfast for guests in the morning. "
37904534,525806398,08/09/2019,97800476,Saeed,"Md's listing was perfect for an overnight stay - good location, a clean spacious room, and a large, comfortable mattress. Good amenities, inlcuding a full sized cupboard, and a clean toilet and shower. 

Md was very accomodating of my late check-in, very communicative/responsive, and I had an easy / no-fuss check-in. 

Snacks and water in the guest's room (though I didn't stay long enough to partake) was very considerate of the host. 

Overall, a very comfortable great night's sleep, and great value for money. Would recommend, and I'd stay there again."

I could go on and on but I already left a review before so check that one out for more details.  Just stay here lol.  I have been to many Airbnbs before, seen a few in London and they have for the most part been a let down, super uncomfortable, almost no privacy, just a mess.  This is a gem, Lina is great, the location is fantastic for travelling around London and the price is super fair.  That is all I have to say."
32582052,459328144,27/05/2019,238559673,Aimee,This property was ideal due to its closeness to the tube station and supermarket. Instructions for check in and out where easy to follow and Jessica and Nev where great to deal with. Thank you

It is very well situated close to buses, trains and to either Soho for plays and night life or central London for the many historic sites one can visit. If you like walking, much of the above is within walking distance without using any transit. The flat is clean, well furnished, with a very comfortable bed. Gabe kindly includes some value adds which we weren't expecting - soap/shampoo which we have seen before but with fruit, cheese, luncheon meat, milk in the fridge. I would stay at the flat again on my next trip to London if it is available. Arranging to arrive and depart is easy through email communication and upon arrival through texting or by phone. "

7569924,77565871,01/06/2016,59208015,John,Our host went out of her way to make us feel welcome. She made sure we obtained our keys from a friend since she was unavailble. Her manual on the Web site was helpful and she replied to our additional questions. You should be aware that the flat is a 4th floor walk up. This is certainly common in Europe.

26096287,408996727,06/02/2019,2777158,Melissa,"Angela's place is pretty near King's Cross, but if you are coming with luggage, do note the walk to the place is a little upslope. The buses might also skip some stops which leaves you walking quite a bit more than expected. But this is due to road works, which seems to be very common in London during this trip of ours.

The house and toilet were extremely clean and the hot water was great (perfect for winter). Heating was also awesome. It can get a little stuffy at times, but you can just open the window to ventilate the room. 

Do note that you cannot store your bags after or before check in/ out but Angela gave a great option to a baggage storage place (it's written on the bedroom door). We used the link and paid 5 pounds per big bag, but if you go down to the store itself, it's only 4 pounds :) 

There is a Waitrose at the halfway mark between King's Cross and Angela's place that is pretty well stocked if you decide to eat in. We had a lovely experience staying with Angela and would love to come back again in the future."

On a freezing cold weekend the little bedroom was so cosy and the shower is brilliant. The location was perfect for me - close to Dpitalfields, Hoxton and Shoreditch, two minutes' walk from a bus stop on the main road, yet quite quiet. Sorry not to see more of my hosts as I had early starts both mornings, but they were very friendly and welcoming and accommodated my uncertain schedule very generously. I'd love to come back!"

The bed was comfortable, the views were amazing, the ceilings were high and the place is furnished stylishly and comfortably. Paul was lovely and a pleasure to be around, it didn't feel as if we were intruding as can often be the way when you book a single Airbnb room in a lived-in apartment. 

The bath and shower were gorgeous and the bathroom was stylish and well equipped.

The place itself was located incredibly close to some major bus lines which would have you in the heart of London within 20 minutes. The views you get from the kitchen of the shard and business district are beautiful.

I wish we could have stayed longer!"

6502403,55784309,06/12/2015,586284,Valeri,"Jonathan was super-helpful--rapid responses to our queries and sent a repairer quickly when we had a couple of issues. Americans may wish to ask detailed questions about the operation of the shower (hint: those knobs are water and water-mix, *not* hot and cold), the combo washer-dryer, and the control pad for the central heat and hot water.
   The building is in a quiet, family neighborhood, but it's a short walk to pubs, shops, and restaurants. The apartment was exactly as represented, and was an ideal place for a 10-day visit. Comfortable bed--so important when you're staying somewhere for several days--and good water pressure in the shower.
   I would stay here again in a heartbeat--highly recommended!"

Furthermore, a lot of the well-known sights are in walking distance (Notting Hill Portobello Road, Hyde Park, Harrods, Kensington Palace). The apartment is small but very clean and beautiful + it has a superb view! 
The hosts are very well organised and helpful. They gave us nice tips for London which we really enjoyed. All in all, they were very keen to make our stay as nice and smooth as possible! Therefore, we can only say that we would definitely book this apartment again and we would also like to come back."

She was very flexible when my plane came it late, was very welcoming when I finally arrived, and helped me with my very heavy luggage up the stairs. The room was perfect for my stay in London. It is in a quieter residential area, but it is located a 5 minute walk to the tube stop, and I was able to get anywhere in the city very easily. It was also great to come home after a long day and just relax and chat with Maria. I look forward to staying with Maria again when I visit London."
22081628,577279774,15/12/2019,43179027,Barbara,"The location of Geoff’s place is amazing and neighbourhood seems safe, the tube is just a walk away. The room is big, clean and has everything you need. The bathroom was really clean too, shared only with a person from other room. I arrived around 23.00 and Geoff was really welcoming despite the hour. 
The only problem is that walls are really thin - you can hear a person in the other room talking. I also didn’t like being woken up by Spanish telenovelas playing somewhere in the house early in the morning. 
But overall - a really nice place for a good price and I really recommend staying here."

The room is good and clean. There are snacks and water provided. Also, tea and breakfast (cereal, egg). You can actually have everything you need in this house! And we are two girls staying there, and we arrived late (11pm) and Darshan is kind enough to pick us up in the nearby bus stop (and saved us for walking in the dark for 10 minutes). 
So we highly recommend this house to everyone! And it’s really cheap and worths every penny or even beyond!"

11157432,553523018,24/10/2019,281801968,Greg,"Room itself fine, “apartment” that it sat in not so good and house very off putting: corridor that would not have looked out of place in a tenement, uneven stairs, dodgy locks. The clean, welcoming room was a complete contrast to the experience from the front door to the room door.
The floor of the level my room was on was warped, the kitchenette too.
However, the kitchenette was well appointed, clean and same for the bathroom.
The rooms (bedroom, kitchenette, bathroom) all shared these features: clean, decently appointed and more than adequate for purpose.
WIFI was so bad it could not even handle email. Top of the house & lots of competing signals so maybe that’s why, but not hard to get right.
The level of street noise was high, but as expected. What I did not expect was the thumping music from next door.
Overall 2/5 with a lift to 3/5 to account for pricing for my purposes. Plenty of room for improvement and centrality of location undermined by adjacent building noise for business use, but if you are travelling for London night life then you’d probably rate it much higher.
Accordingly, my lower score reflects in part that it was not a suitable venue for my needs (long days of business meetings) as much as the criticisms I have of it."

La disponibilità durante la mia permanenza è stata totale. La stanza è esattamente come la si vede in foto, piccola ma accogliente; soprattutto molto calda (ho dormito senza coperte e con la finestra aperta in pieno novembre). La zona è centrale ma molto tranquilla, la vicinanza con più stazioni della metro è molto importante. In generale sono molto soddisfatto dell'esperienza e ritornerò sicuramente a trovare Vn e Sheila se dovessi tornare a Londra."

30286590,437794101,15/04/2019,165771375,Dominic,"This unit is located just off Trafalgar Square. It’s an extremely convenient location for theater-going and cultural offerings and an easy Tube ride to pretty much anywhere you want to go. James is a courteous and prompt host – he met us on arrival and was able to offer information advice on everything from train travel to dining options. The unit itself is bright, clean and fairly spacious; nicely if somewhat sparsely furnished. It’s on the second level, accessible by stairs and a lift.  The building itself is quiet, but given the busy location, there’s a fair amount of urban noise that goes into the evening hours. We understood this when we booked the place, and didn’t find the noise to be disruptive. There’s a binder helpfully detailing all manner of entertainment and dining options that we found quite helpful.  All in all, we had a fine stay and would recommend to friends who wanted to be in the middle of things."

We spent some time at the nearby London Archive, walked along the Thames path from Richmond and spent several hours at Kew Botanical Gardens all within easy access.  It was great that we could leave our overnight bag at the house before and after check in.   Breakfast was excellent, freshly squeezed orange juice and quality coffee!  We would definitely stay again if in the area and would fully recommend anyone visiting Kew Gardens etc to make Moira's your base.

We took a night flight and arrived at the flat around 9am. She was gracious and had it ready for us. She has very good instructions for using the different appliances and heaters, etc. The flat has everything you need. Beautiful linens, kitchen is stocked nicely, as far as dishes, pans, appliances, etc.  There is a lovely patio that gets full afternoon sun and was great to sit in. 
The flat is on the 3rd floor and it is quite a distant walk from the elevator and has about 15-20 steps down on a winding staircase to the living area.  It would be difficult for older people or anyone with bad knees, back, feet, etc.  one of the pluses staying at Irina's flat is that the tube station is about 2 blocks and the grocery shops are very close by, too."

A quiet, attractive part of town just a short walk from ‘West Kensington’ and ‘Barons Court’ tube stations with a large number of local amenities ‘just around the corner’.
The flat itself is relatively spacious and well equipped for a short stay in the capital. Our only issue was that although advertised as ‘self contained’ it is in fact separated from the owners house via a locked internal door meaning a degree of privacy is lost however this did not detract from our stay which we enjoyed immensely…

High standards are evident in every way.
Their hospitality was very warm and I looked forward each evening to a cup of tea and a slice of home-made orange cake which was generously provided. Yum!

This room is not as small as a picture.
Our host is so kind and the room is clean. 
If there is one thing i’m sorry about, the noise of the people climbing on the stairs is a little bit loud.(wood sound) 
And one more thing, i got a message from host that i used the bathroom badly.(lots of hair in the drain) but I think it was the amount of hair that two women could come out of. And The bathroom was cleaned every day, but the hair was only held for a few days.
I paid for the accommodation and cleaning(by airbnb), and I do not understand that I received such a letter.

You have a whole floor to yourself with bedroom and bathroom so it feels really private. Arthea was very kind and went to great lengths to make me feel welcome. I’d told her not to worry about breakfast as I’m gluten and dairy free. When I arrived there was gluten free granola and oat milk which was totally unexpected and so lovely. The place was clean, warm and comfortable. I’ll be back!"

I did not like the fact that there was a flowing water noise in the room which makes it very difficult to fall asleep . Also they have a little girl who is really lovely but unfortunately wakes up very, very early at 6 or 7 am and for people who want to be fresh and do things it is impossible.  Sofia tried to convince me that it is a normal fact kids to be noisy and i understand if they have relatives there but not people who are paying for their stay and expect no disturbance at all. I think Carlos and  Sofia should either stop advertising for airbnb hosts because of the girl they have or to really make necessary arrangements for their family responsibilities not to disturb the guests. Definitely these two facts I mentioned before were very disturbing."

Carron and Paul accomodated us on a late notice, in the warmest and most welcoming manner. We felt so comfortable with their company, it is a true pleasure to meet them. 

The place was very charming, beautifully decorated, very clean. A hotel experiance would not have come close to the pleasure we experienced staying with locals in a quiet but very fun and well sitiuated London neighborhood. 
And I kid you not, we saw a couple of foxes in they courtyard. I was happy and excited as a kid in a zoo to see the foxes.
If we could give Carron and Paul's apartment more stars, we would.

But Catherine was a perfect host for us. 
When we lost nearby flat, she came out to find us. And when we arrived at her flat she kindly explained everything include how to use the heater, Wifi, cab,  etc. Also Catherine provided us with fruits and fresh milk  in the fridge. We were impressed by the attentiveness of her.

The flat is located  within 1 minute distance walking of bus Stn(139,189), supermarket(if you need you can top up Oyster Card), restaurants and bars of Abbey Road. 
Oxford Street(15-20 minutes on the bus), Notting Hill (20 minutes on the bus) and Regent Park(25-30 minutes by walk) are also a short distance away. So we liked go to the Regent Park by walk in the morning.


We definitely recommend staying here, and if we visit to London again  I will book her flat again. 
That's totally awesome!

Thanks for a great time!"

23758335,318766157,04/09/2018,28281973,Stanley,"This area of South East London, including the popular and stylish East Dulwich has a notorious lack of hotels and so this relatively new addition to the Airbnb scene is fantastic. 

Both rooms are private, in a shared space above a welcoming  local pub. I’ve used this pub for many years and it’s a fine example of a British pub. A garden for summer and cosy fires in winter. 

The accommodation is accessed from an outdoor stairway through a private gate with 24 hour access to the road - so you’re not reliant on the pub being open to come and go. 

The rooms are clean, comfortable, and one has an en-suite bathroom. The other room shares a shower and bathroom with the shared area. 

But the main bonus here is the price. Considering rooms could be occupied by 4 people - this is an incredible bargain for London. You won’t find a better deal. 

Transport to central London is by bus. The bus stop is directly outside the pub - very convenient. Buses are every 3 minutes. 

Your host Stephen (the owner of the pub) is very welcoming, even suggesting I join him downstairs for a drink! All in all an excellent experience at a sensational price. 

I shall be returning."

Whilst around the corner from the exceptionally busy Tower Bridge, it is a quiet, tranquil spot which made for beautiful relaxed evenings overlooking the mariner. Waitrose supermarket is literally across the street which was very convenient.  I was delighted with the place and my parents loved staying there.  Can highly recommend to anyone wanting a comfortable, convenient spot in the centre of London."

The location is fine, there is a good transport connection to the city, but I would recommend to bring earplugs, because there are trains passing by almost all night."

9662314,90173534,31/07/2016,19974502,Chiara,"Such a great flat. The location and design of the place were just exceptional. I would absolutely recommend anyone looking for a flat with authenticity and character to stay there.

The decoration is of great taste, with impressive original art collection, unseen for a rental flat. A great selection of art and photography books makes one want to stay and read, and if you start going through the film collection (and indulge a cinema with the projector) you will be astonished. They are all here, from Hitchcock, Truffaut, Godard, Tarkovsky, the Cohen brothers, Jarmush, Rossellini, Pasolini...

You can literally walk to Notting Hill, Maida Vale or cross the Park to south Kensington in 10minutes, and the rest of London is easily accessible through the central, district and Bakerloo lines.

The neighbourhood itself is very charming, well separated from the tourist-invaded Paddington area and surrounded by a few but excellent bars and restaurants. L'Angelus, a French restaurant actually recommended by JP, is definitely a must do ! A French grocery just next door is opened from 7am to 1am have all the products you could dream in Paris, including fresh baked croissants !

If you get lucky with the weather, taking the sun on the terrace is exquisite and a real enjoyment at breakfast or for a diner outside (there are nice plants, candles, etc) and Having Hyde Park a couple of minutes away is so precious, either for a run, a pic nic or just for a simple walk.

Thanks again for such a wonderful experience."

Very good convince stores, nice restaurants close and even a Tesco Express.

My wife, 3 young children and I spent 2 nights there and left with new friends in both Shazia and her daughter Zoya. They are incredibly generous people, making us feel very welcome. Shazia provided breakfast and snacks for our children and even dinner one evening after a long day.

Their home is very clean and simple - perfect for people wanting a place to sleep then getting out to explore. However, if you do choose to relax there and Shazia is around, she is a very interesting person to talk to.

On our last day we had a minor accident and couldn't drive out to our next destination. Shazia had new guests coming but offered her front living room couches for us if we couldn't find a new place. We are so grateful to have met them and look forward to staying there again on a future trip.

Nun zum großen ABER: das Apartment bedarf dringend Schönheitsreparaturen (die Böden und Wände sind dreckig, genauso wie das Bad/WC). Die Kommunikation mit den ""Ko-Gastgebern"", die ab dem Einchecken übernahmen, war völlig uneffektiv: mehrfache Anfragen meinerseits mit Einwilligung des Zahlens eines Aufpreises für den Austausch von Handtüchern/Betttüchern wurden einfach ignoriert. Statt dessen war fast jeden Tag jemand im Apartment, um irgendetwas zu checken (wie Elektrogeräte, Brandschutz und was auch immer). Nach diesen Begehungen war das Apartment noch dreckiger. Es war leider eine der schlechtesten Erfahrungen über AirBnB. Sollte der Eigentümer die Wohnung renovieren/grundreinigen, kann ich das Apartment aufgrund der Lage empfehlen. So aber nicht..."

We came to London for the marathon and it was so close to the tube stop, and virtually next to the start line.
I would 100% stay here again in future and have recommended Emilly's property to friends and family.
She left us complimentary wine, water, pop, tea, coffee and milk which was an amazing welcome gift!
The amenities were outstanding with plenty of pots, pans and utensils for our family to use to self cater. The location is great as there are plenty of shops nearby - we used Iceland, Tesco express etc. there were also butchers and plenty of fast food takeaways nearby.
I cannot thank Emilly enough for her hospitality and her incredibly clean, perfect home.
She also left plenty of shower gels/creme's, toilet rolls etc.

The apartment is quiet and conveniently located, within a short walk from 2 different tubestations. Everything was exactly as described and shown in the pictures. 

I think staying at Ulanah's place suits particularly well to anyone who has rather busy schedule while in London and is looking for a peaceful and secure place to rest and sleep.

First, it is *very* noisy, as the walls are paper thin, so bring ear plugs for sleeping (I did, and it was completely fine!). Second, it is up an enormous amount of stairs. However, I quite liked this free exercise and you might too (plus it makes for impressive fitness app statistics at the end of the day!). It's an excellent excellent location, in terms of access to the tube, and proximity to Portabello Road and Hyde Park. I really loved the location. The apartment is slightly shabbier than it looks in photos, but for the price you can't complain! The contact person for me was extremely nice and responsive, and check in was easy (lock box). I would certainly stay again, if looking for something practical."

Perry foi pontual e muito atencioso conosco, mostrando-nos o flat e nos informando sobre o funcionamento de tudo, além de ter se colocado à disposição para qualquer problema eventual, para o que ficamos com o número do seu celular. E nos recebeu com uma garrafa de vinho! Muito bom! Camdem Town é um bairro excelente, com tudo o que é necessário perto e uma vida noturna bastante eclética. A estação de metrô não é próxima (cerca de 10 minutos caminhando tranquilamente), mas há uma parada de ônibus para vários pontos da cidade a apenas uma quadra. O flat excedeu nossas expectativas para uma semana em Londres: a cozinha é completa; TV com múltiplos canais de filmes, notícias e esporte; Wi-Fi excelente! Os dois quartos são bastante pequenos, mas as camas são muito confortáveis, o que fez com que o tamanho realmente não fosse um problema. Banho excelente! Eu e minha família gostamos muito da experiência. Recomendo fortemente o flat. Retornaremos, com certeza!"

It's a big flat for London situated in quiet residential area and close to all transport and other amenities. We were five minutes from the underground and it is on the Northern Line so you get everywhere pretty quickly. Camden is one stop away. You're about 15 minutes to Oxford Circus and 15 minutes to London Bridge, which has you at the Festival Pier in minutes. Ours was a shopping sightseeing vacation for four days and with an 11 year old and 7 year old I couldn't have picked a more convenient location, getting places quickly a must with kids. It's a bright flat with WIFI and we were thrilled at the sight of a local city fox we saw each morning at breakfast who likes to take a nap on one of the roof tops across the street. It's also a safe apartment building so I felt I could leave my belongings there and not have to drag them with me all day. She has very nice neighbours. I'd book Julia's apartment again without hesitation. "

16064677,122872023,26/12/2016,17026005,Charina,"We opted to stay at this property as our tiny flat could not accommodate the whole family over Christmas. There was plenty of room for 6 people and could have even had a couple more if they are willing to sleep on the large couch.
The dinning/living area enabled the family to have a Christmas celebration with ease. The only thing that made things a little difficult was that the oven was a little small to cook a large meal. You couldn't cook much at a time.
The beds were comfortable and once the heating was on the rooms were warm and cosy. 
At the time of our stay, the shower head in the downstairs shower was broken and therefore we had to share the one shower which took getting ready a bit longer. However I'm sure Samy has probably replaced this already and shouldn't be an issue for further bookings. 
Communication with Samy was excellent. He called me a week before and kept in contact via email and (Hidden by Airbnb) . I would recommend the property to others! "

Jeremy greeted us, showed us round the place and was warm and friendly. He's made an extensive folder that has maps of the local area and shows you how to use household things ie tv/stereo. The flat is the perfect size and has a lovely feel about it. It's modern and beautifully decorated with style and is super clean! It has a wonderful sound system if you wanna connect your ipod to some speakers. The garden has a lovely table/umbrella and is perfect for breakfast. It's a great sun trap. Its perfect for a romantic weekend away or a working trip - it had everything you need. It's a great pad for chilling out and relaxing and is lovely and bright. It's in a great location, 30 mins walk from brick lane and Spitafields market. One stop from bank, it's very close to central London. As it's on the DLR, it's also perfect location for visiting greenwich and East London. We will definitely be staying here again! Thanks J! "

On arrival the first impressions are always important .the front door and entrance needed attention compared with the adjacent properties,a good coat of paint would do it.We were disappointed with the lack of TLC in the apartment,broken kitchen table,toilet plunger,no water stop in the bathroom basin,bathroom door did not close and had no lock,.The bedroom had no reading lights,the only furnishings being the bed ,a single stand up lamp and only one bedside table..
For the price paid we expected something more.

The open space living room and kitchen is comfortable, and you can control the heating for the winter weather. Spent eleven nights during last Christmas so I never visited the roof terrace but the apartment was very comfortable. The kitchen has every tool you might need. The Nespreso machine was very good as well as a new washing machine. I looked at YouTube videos for operating instructions. A cordless vacuum cleaner is available. The TV is a Smart category, you can access your Netflix account with. Though we never meet in person communication with Ida was excellent. Check-in and check out were easily coordinated, she left a friend to receive us and hand us the keys. Plenty of good eating places and to buy food from the underground station to the apartment. A pharmacy is right in front. Ida did everything possible for us to feel good in her apartment. If my knees keep holding me enough to climb stairs I would definitely love to come back for a longer stay. I highly recommend Ida’s place."

21780642,294725645,22/07/2018,59047946,Olivia,"The photos do no do this apartment justice, it is absolutely amazing! It’s spacious, clean, with modern and quirky finishes. We used the apartment for 10 people and all the beds were comfortable including the sofa beds, which were very large. The host provides numerous fans in case the nights are too warm. For the price this place is a steal to stay. The apartment is well located for getting to and from and Uber’s to the surrounding nightlife were cheap. The area is residential and quiet, although you don’t have to worry about making too much noise. David is quick to respond to messages and when we got to the apartment messaged to make sure we were happy with everything. To anyone who is considering booking this Airbnb, I would highly recommend.

La maison est très propre et fonctionnelle. La jardin est très agréable, les enfants ont profité du trampoline. Le quartier est très sympa, il y a pas mal de petits restos (take away), des supermarchés et des espaces verts.

The entire house is clean and airy and the host was thoughtful who was prepared a lovely food basket and a bottle of wine. Furthermore the view is amazing through the kitchen window which it is quite hard to find a peaceful place in such a Morden city. We had a fantastic travel experience, we will love to stay in here again. Thank you Nirosh."

The flat is perfectly located near all the incredible restaurants, bakeries, wine bars and shops of Notting Hill. The neighborhood is very charming and safe, and their flat is beautifully decorated. The room was very comfortable at the end of a long day, and having a clean private bathroom was really nice. And rolling out of bed and spending the morning at Portobello Market was ideal. Terrific experience all around!"

15909968,401637868,15/01/2019,54464788,Lorenzo,"The airbnb itself left a bit to be desired, but overall it was a decent stay for the price of the stay. The location of the place was the best part, as it is near 2 Tube stations (Queensway and Bayswater) that are 2-3 minutes away by foot. Plenty of restaurants and bakeries nearby as well. At the end of the street there conveniently a large park called Hyde Park which is worth the trip. The kitchen, although we did not use, would not be very suitable for cooking as it is very small and the fridge did not seem that cold to keep beverages or food in. Unfortunately when walking down to the apartment, there was a heavy smell of cigarette smoke, but luckily that smell was not present whilst in the Airbnb. Towards the end of just about every night, it was quite noisy from the adjacent rooms with music being played or loud talking in general. There was also the small issue of finding a few bugs in the bathroom just on the first night of our stay. All in all, if you are just looking for a simple and small place in a good location to sleep in (with 2 beds fortunately), then it will do the job."

This is a lovely, spacious flat in a great location. It was a wonderful, comfy, clean space in which to self isolate in. The nearby parks and Alexandra Palace were lovely. There are shops and restaurants very close by but the road and property are quiet. I wouldn't hesitate to book this property again."

A unique layout of the flat with one bedroom on the ground floor (""a converted garage""), and 2 smaller bedrooms in the converted attic. Very pleasant stay for 6 people (4 adults, 2 kids). Kitchen is well-appointed. Housekeeping was a bit lackadaisical (missing soap in kitchen, paper towels in kitchen, no washcloths in the bathrooms). No worries, there is a ""Poundland"" store across the street to stock up on cheap household items if necessary. Would definitely consider staying here again when in London!"

I would definitely recommend if you are on a leisure tour with no early morning schedule and especially if your activities area is on the west. I would recommend less if you are landing in Standsted (3 hrs) and if your activities are more downtown: consider 1hr 15 mins to 1.5 hrs (peak) and 5 GBP one way to central London (Victoria/St. Paul). But again, the place itself is great and Lark is very nice, if you have no time restriction, I definitely recommend. "

The house was spotless , comfortable and the fridge always full for us to be able to prepare generous breakfast ; fresh flowers everyday...The house is well situated , in front of the bus stop leading to the railway station ; there, trains to London run very frequently ( each 15 minutes or so ) and it takes about half an hour to get to Liverpool street station .The best is probably to get an Oyster card for travelling , both to Romford and London .All and all , a very good experience to be recommended ."

4677249,55604434,03/12/2015,12523570,Edle,"All the reviewers are right : Lord is truly exceptional, and his apartment is perfect. Lord Henry is not only a hospitality professional of the highest rank; his kindness, attentiveness and welcoming attitude run deep in him as a person. 

Lord and his friend Jordan met me at the airport and took me to the apartment, which is literally across the runway from Heathrow. The apartment is carefully furnished, clean and looks newly renovated. The bedroom and mattress were just perfect. 

Lord cooked such a delicious meal for me. I wish I could do a cooking class with him! The broth and mushroom soup was so tasty, and the duck amazing. Lord was not there in the morning, but he had prepared everything for my breakfast very carefully. The free shuttle bus to Heathrow is just across the road, and was very easy to access. 

I had a very restful night in the apartment of Lord Henry. He made my long transit in London a stay and an experience in its own right, not just a stop over. 

Lord Henry is a positive and inspiring person that makes me belive in humanity. "

Don't let the small bedroom fool you, Conny's and Toby's (and little Johann's) house is essentially your home during your stay. The kitchen, the living room, the fridge, the pantry, the small garden, ... everything was open to us! We were treated like friends rather than paying guests. Conny and Toby were very helpful, open and curious throughout our stay and shared a few meals and breakfasts with us. You really feel like home and get a glimpse into a local family's daily routines.

Their home is clean, really(!) nicely furnished and every little detail (from soap, UK power adapters and towels) was taken care of. We were really lucky with our choice, we are most certainly coming back if possible!

Sidenote: To our surprise, Conny is originally from Germany, which came in handy to us on more than one occasion!"

The location is exceptional and convenient if you choose to Uber into the center of London or walk a couple blocks to the tube station. The apartment is nicely furnished with contemporary kitchen and bath.  The host provided coffee, cereal and fruits that was very convenient for a quick bite each morning.

Never ever had those bad  experience with any air b&b owners or agents, really disappointed and sad!

We had problems with the outlets not working and the wifi turning off. The biggest problem was that there were two other guests who took a bag of my toiletries and when I asked Gabriel to talk to them he didn't. I had to wait for them to be in the apartment and discuss it with them myself which was very uncomfortable. They ended up using all of my things including my razor.... I would not stay here again.

The apartment and the private room were comfortable and cozy with a comfy bed and good Wi-Fi connection. The bathroom was also very clean. It’s a 3 min. walk to Southwark Station. I liked how fast and easy it was to travel to points of interest using the tube. The apartment is also close to a small convenience store, in case you get the munchies like we did. I would totally recommend Dan’s place and would stay here again."

There is an elevator which is handy when you have a troller. The area down the block is great for playing when you have a toddler. The place in itself was wide enough to accommodate a couple with a kid, overall clean."

The bathroom is a bit tight, but modern and worked just great for us. Tabitha was a fantastic host. She communicated with us quickly and gave us all the necessary information we needed. She even recommended some local places for us to visit. Our flight was cancelled and we were forced to rent a car; when we arrived early in the morning after driving all night Tabitha had a parking pass ready for us. It is a short walk to Mile End station from the flat. The neighbourhood is charming, with a some nice local pubs. Highly recommend the flat and Tabitha. We would love to stay here again on our next visit to London. "

His hospitality is first class and he is a considerate, helpful and knowledgeable host. The house is exactly as described and is warm and comfortable. We slept really well. The ,location is excellent, in a quiet cul-de-sac yet moments from the bustling Kensington High Street and a 10 minute walk to 2 tube stations and the regular bus routes into the West End. We could not fault anything and this will always be our number one choice for return stays in the capital. Thank you Adelmo."

We had plenty to do in London thanks to their recommendations and the house being at 25mn from anywhere in metro makes it a perfect location to visit London. 

The district itself, Clapham North, has plenty of bars and restaurants and its own nightlife, which makes it an additional area to spend time.

L'environnement est très agréable également, en face d'un parc, à proximité d'un quartier vivant et à 5 minutes de la station de train London Fields et des bus. Aucun risque d'être dérangé par le bruit la nuit ! Nous avons dormi comme des bébés. 
Compter 30 à 40 minutes pour atteindre le centre ""touristique"" de Londres (un temps de trajet normal pour la ville) mais 15 minutes pour le quartier branché de Shoreditch.

Ahmed ist sehr nett und obwohl wir deutlich später angekommen sind als vereinbart war er trotzdem zur Schlüsselübergabe da und konnte sogar deswegen nicht zur Arbeit. 
Die Privatsphäre wurde auch geachtet. 
Allerdings finden wir das Prinzip dass jeder nach seinem Aufenthalt selber putzen muss nicht gut, es sei denn es wird kontrolliert was bei unserer Ankunft nicht war. Das Bad war sehr dreckig und ob die Decke und das Kissen gewaschen wurde können wir nur hoffen... 
wir mussten erst mal selber putzen um uns halbwegs wohl zu fühlen."

1568716,37236905,05/07/2015,151639,Duncan,"I had an uneven experience. The location was perfect for me: it's a short walk from Feltham station, in a residential area with a regular and quick bus connection to Heathrow. I had an early flight, so I chose somewhere close in the hope of getting extra sleep. 

Zareen's home is the end house in a street of tidy semi-detached homes. I was welcomed nicely, shown the kitchen and living and, of course, my bedroom. The house is clean and the furnishings show a warm and rich taste. This wasn't the room pictured, but instead a better-furnished bedroom at the front of the ground floor. 

Sadly, noise prevented me from sleeping well. There was the noise of loud conversation (I imagine from the neighbours' living room) well past midnight and, from around 3.15 am to 4.15 am, continuous and agitated hammering on the door of the house: the sort of hammering that didn't made me feel like opening the door. I later discovered this was from a guest who was in another room but had lost his key.

These disturbances were both external to the house, but they mean that I would not return there. "

Abbiamo trovato Desmond molto gentile e riservato, ci ha messo a disposizione anche la sua cucina perfettamente servita di ogni elettrodomestico.

Moreover, David was easy to communicate with and he always answered promptly to our messages.

주변에는 초등학교가 있고 경찰학교도 있으며 주거지역이라 치안이 좋은 느낌을 받았습니다 새벽에는 오히려 길가에 아무도없어서 조금 무서웠습니다
킹스크로스역에서 3정거장이면 도착합니다 걸어가도 괜찮은 거리입니다
저는 히드로공항으로 들어왔고 나갈땐 유로스타를 탔기때문에 숙소위치가 저에겐 딱 좋았습니다.
 
게스트에게 내어주는 방은 굉장히 아늑하고 편안합니다
사실 사진에 보이는 것 보다 더 좋습니다
옷걸이도 굉장히 많고 전기장판도 있어서 하루에 사계절이 모두 느껴지는 런던날씨를 견딜수 있습니다
모니카는 새벽2시에 돌아오지 않는 나를 걱정해주었고 저는 굉장히 미안했습니다 그녀는 가끔 나의 영어발음을 고쳐주기도했고 영어가 짧은 저를 많이 배려해줬습니다. 머무르는 동안 나누었던 대화가 매우 즐거웠고 친절하고 유쾌한 모니카 덕분에 런던에서의 여행이 좋은 기억으로 남았습니다. 정해진 규칙만 잘 지킨다면(세탁기 말하고 사용, 싱크대는 항상 비워놓기 등) 무리없이 좋은 추억만드실 수 있습니다. 고마워요 모니카"

I loved this apartment and would highly recommend it to anyone!"
4332039,43218555,18/08/2015,31316117,Micah,"Richard was very professional and welcoming, even accommodating the fact that I arrived an hour early. The neighborhood isn't the nicest, I didn't see a lot of eateries that I'd want to go to, and the 17 minute walk to the metro station feels like an eternity with bags, but the room itself, the private bathroom, and the price make it well worth it. I would definitely stay here again."

9927747,257740510,27/04/2018,35218115,David,"Unfortunately one bad review from a man that demanded more fridge space than allocated, bought washing with him and then wanted to do his washing in the bath when told he could not use the washing machine immediately. Along with not listening to the instructions being given and talking over the conversation and then seeking out the neighbours to complain about not getting his own way.
Airbnb have blocked this room for no reason other than choosing to believe this review without investigating.
Their review includes a character assassination that should not be allowed. If you think the room is no good berate the service or the room.
Airbnb left this review up and it amounts to bullying in my book. As Airbnb refuse to give an answer to Nadya directly this is the only action that can be taken.
Nadya gave a gracious review  to this man in my opinion.
I have lost the ability to rent this excellent room at the moment until Airbnb start talking to Nadya."

Das niedliche Gartenhaus ist super eingerichtet und hat alles was man für einen Londontrip benötigt. Danke für die schöne Zeit. We will come back again. Regards Sam & Frank
1113888,124987136,03/01/2017,2083643,Roger,"Will and Pam's place is an excellent choice for London travelers looking to stay in a quieter part of the central city.  The flat is walking distance to the Borough Street Market and Monmouth Coffee Company which was a big plus if you are picky about your espresso and food.

The flat itself was extremely clean and had nice comfortable amenities. If you are ever in need of a household good, Sainsbury (store) is just around the corner. Roebuck was a nice bar nearby where you can stop for a night cap at the end of the day.

Overall, we enjoyed staying there very much and felt it was a much better deal than staying in the central business district of London."

7817541,176713787,31/07/2017,129675369,Tony,"Richard's place is great and is set in really nice location away from the main streets.

Public transport is on the doorstep with the Overland less than 5 mins away.

Stoke Newington has lots of shops and eateries and Abney Park is well worth a wander.....old graveyard and disused church...a perfect film set.

Richard is a great host and was really focussed on ensuring we were greated, settled and remained happy throughout our stay.

The kids loved the idea that Amy Winehouse had a video shot in / near Gibson Gardens and also bits of The Krays were filmed in Stoke Newington."
53041,211153,28/03/2011,432794,Caroline,"Ciaran made us feel at home from the first minute of our stay. He is such a nice guy, easy to chat to, knows about when to advice on 'places to be' or give you the privacy you expect and even made me a lovely cup of ginger & lemon tea when I did come down with a cold!
The room is very spacious, clean and the bed big and comfy enough for two, makes sounds when turning though :)
The area is nice, with a sainsbury on the corner, restaurants, coffee shops and the tube station maybe 7 minutes away (Kilburn). It does take you around half an hour+ to go to the center but we made the experience that this will be the case from almost everywhere in London as there is always a tube line in maintenance at the weekends and the stay at Ciaran is worth a few more minutes ride! If you aren't a dog lover, Ciaran's dog is going to change your mind. He is sweet as sugar! We (my boyfriend and I) can definitely recommend to stay in Ciaran's room and also if I were to stay there on my own I wouldn't have one sec of a concern. Caroline & Jacob

Il y a également des bus de nuit qui passent tout près de la maison. Très bon rapport qualité prix.

German-speaking guests will definitely feel at home here as both Yak & Maddy can speak the language. There was even a German multiplug in the room so you don't need an adapter. The room was exactly as pictured and the double bed will fit 2 persons comfortably. I liked the place overall, really felt at home. Location is also great, as it's halfway between Heathrow and the city centre on the Picadilly line. About half an hour's journey by train either way. Would definitely stay again. "

I booked short notice as I wanted to surprise my girlfriend for Valentine's Day and take her to London for the weekend. She was super helpful and guided me throughout the process of the Cardiff-London commute! Gave us loads of tips about the neighbourhood, like the Broadway market/flower market, Brick Lane and London Fields lido. Also bought a bottle of wine for us and left echinacea out for Gemma's sore throat!

The flat has an incredibly soothing, healing energy to it. Exactly like the lovely photos and more :) Bed is wonderful to sleep in and bath is amazing. Lulu is an amazing dog, we absolutely loved having out with her!

To summarise, we left uplifted and well rested, with some amazing new experiences.

Would definitely visit agin! If not for anything else but Jodi's yoga classes next time. Thank you very, very much!"

Ted was very welcoming, after a visit to the apartment he gave us advice on places to visit and places.

Nous avons passé un super week end en famille  avec nos deux enfants de 7 et 10 ans dans l'appartement de Tiziana !!
Il est identique aux photos c'est à dire très bien décoré et très propre !! Nous n'avons pas  eu la chance de rencontrer Tiziana mais nous avons bien échangé avant et pendant notre séjour, tous était bien organisé.
L'appartement se situe à moins de 10mn à pied de la gare et à 8mn en train de Liverpool street . Nous avons écouté le conseil de Tiziana et avons téléchargé l'application CITYMAPPER , et cela nous a beaucoup aidé ! L'appartement est très bien équipé, nous n'avions pas penser à l'adaptateur pour les prises françaises, et l'appartement est équipé de prise usb !! Nous avons donc pu charger nos téléphones et tablettes sans aucun soucis .

The room offered is small as is, but about 1/4 of it is occupied by miscellaneous clutter. “2 single beds” means a rollaway and an air mattress, and the towels we were given were just bath mats. The private bath is home to the cats litter box, which causes it to smell exactly how you’d expect. I suppose it is a decent stay for such a low price, but don’t expect any luxury."

The bed was comfortable and there were several shelves to put our things-- a bonus when living out of suitcase!

The train runs across from the apartment building but it didn't bother us much at night.  I would definitely stay here again!

Tony was incredibly conscientious, even placing a worried call to me when I was delayed in arriving at his flat in the middle of a downpour. Tony thought of everything, and a comfortable bed, stock of basic toiletries, a hair dryer, and wi-fi access greater me upon arrival. The flat is convenient to the Stockwell underground stop, and in a lovely and peaceful neighborhood.  I felt very safe as a single traveler. I would definitely stay with Tony again! "

She gave me a bigger room than agreed, equipped with a fridge (full of brrakfast ingredients!). The neighborhood is calm and clean, and public transport is minutes away (half an hour to city center). The apartment was quiet. The only complaint I have is that the room did not feel very clean, it was a bit dusty and the linen smelled a bit (the bathroom was clean), however, nothing major."

Checking in was super easy, and Ano was really helpful with info on getting around. There are a couple of bus stops right outside the apartment that will bring you right into the center of London. word of warning: to use the bus, you NEED and Oyster card or a touch credit card. There's a grocery store that's only a 5 minute walk from the apartment. 

The listing says it's walkable to Big Ben, which it is, but just remember that you also need to walk back, so it may be good to have another way home in mind.

This was a great place to stay for a few days, and if I get the chance to come back to London I'll 100% look into this place again."

I had a week long stay at start of my job at St. George's Hospital till I got space at my workplace and staying here helped me a lot to get along. The place is 7-10 minutes peaceful walk to the hospital and Collier's Wood tube station is just 5-7 minutes walk as well, so getting along is quite practical.

I also have to complement at excellent attitude of the host. I was attended by Claudette during my stay and she was extremely helpful on everything from checking in my luggage early to providing tips to access areas around. The house is super clean and tidy and the room I was given is one of most spacious rooms I have stayed in UK. There is also TV in room and Free WIFI which really enhances the experience.

I would highly recommend this place to singles or couples looking for a serene stay at a highly clean setup and reasonable price. Really thanks to the host for helping me get acquainted to my new workplace."

And that planes would start flying over at 5:30. It was literally like standing on the runway with planes leaving every 5 minutes. WiFi did not work and he did not put a lot of effort into resolving the issue. Ended up paying my cellular company so I could have internet access. Also, host did not mention he was having a large backyard construction project going on that hindered access to the cabin. He sent an email less than 24 hours before check-in about having a project starting, but this was more than a newly started small project."

Le camere sono carine e ci sono più bagni a disposizione: nei bagni manca una piccola base d'appoggio per le proprie c ose e un tappetino per la doccia, ma si può rimediare!La posizione è perfetta; solo 5 min a piedi da Liverpool street station e altre stazioni metro. Vicino al Tower  Bridge. Abbiamo avuto un piccolo problema con l'assegnazione della camera che non corrispondeva a quella scelta, però Francesco ci ha offerto una camera superiore.

It’s located in a great area of Shoreditch close to everything you want to see in the area. It’s a shared flat but completely private, it’s the best option I’ve seen on air Bnb in regards to a shared space. It’s basically like renting an entire flat to yourself. The only downsides as some have mentioned is late night street noise and characters outside. It borders on entertaining and annoying but it really wasn’t that big of a deal to us. She provides ear plugs and night masks if it’s an issue. The hot water runs out after a single shower so that can be a little frustrating if it’s cold out.  We will definitely try to book again when we come back."

4556381,36795119,01/07/2015,13073120,Natalie,"This place could be a good base for someone who is not looking to spend much time in the apartment-- as in, you're going to wake up early, spend the day out in London, and then come back to sleep.

The reason is, it's very central. The location is perfectly located, off a small street near the Kensington High Street tube station. All along this small street there are beautiful, old buildings, a church, and a few little shops and restaurants. It's very charming.

The downside to this is, the church is LOUD. It serves as a school as well, so early in the morning you'll be woken up by the kids (the church is very, very close; pretty much right in the backyard), the church bells, or in our experience, the construction right outside the window.

The other thing you should know is that this is one of two rooms that may be rented out while you stay, so chances are, if you are here, the other room might be rented out to one to three people. It's a very, very, very small apartment (no living room or common area, no space to sit down in the kitchen, no real room in the hall), so with this many guests and one bathroom, it can get a bit tight.

But as I said, this won't matter much if you're just using the space for its location and a very comfortable bed!

Oh! We had a lot of trouble with the slow wifi connection, too! Not sure if there were just too many computers trying to access the network at once, or what, but it was very slow and sometimes just did not work at all.

That's it, though. Great location!"

The house is a very clean,  peaceful place to stay and as someone not used to AirBnB,  I felt very relaxed and welcome. The park nearby was a pleasant way to start the day and to take a breather in the evening and I would have loved to spend longer to be able to visit the Lavender field. Noreen was generous and helpful and it was important to her that we were comfortable and happy. Which we were!

The complimentary tea was perfect and we made use of her kitchen. We found Oval station to be closer than Vauxhall.

I was going to cancel our booking when we realised it would be past midnight before we could get there and we didn't think she'd want that. Sarah said she was ok with whatever time we got there and even came down to give us our parking permit when we got there at 12:30 a.m! She had bought us bottles of water and stuff for sandwiches, as she knew we were queuing for Wimbledon the next day and we were moved by her thoughtfulness. We had to leave at 4 a.m the next day and she asked us to keep one of the apartment keys if we wanted to nip back for a change or shower. We were only there for about 5 hrs in total and would have loved to have had more time to talk to Sarah. Sarah even allowed us to leave our car there the entire day while we watched the tennis. Great hostess, fantastic night's sleep (even if it was only 4.5 hrs) and excellent location for the tennis ..what more can you ask? "

He was away while I was there, but he arranged for a friend of his to meet up with me and give me the keys. The location is very good, a short walk to Holborn station, and not very far from UCL, the LSE and the British Museum.  During daytime, it is well light, at night it is relatively quiet (traffic is light in that street). "

14629728,181288880,12/08/2017,23025961,Ryan,"Max and Billie's studio in Notting Hill was a fantastic find for our four-night stay in London. It is located in a beautiful, quiet neighborhood near Kensington Gardens, close to public transit and had everything we needed for our stay.

Slightly outside the hectic, crowded center of London, the apartment is a nice place to return after a full day of sightseeing. The Notting Hill Gate tube station is a short four minute walk and can take you practically anywhere in London. And if you're taking the train in from Heathrow, the apartment is a very short trip from Paddington Station, the destination of most Heathrow trains.

The apartment is exactly as pictured and very clean. It is quite small, but provided more than enough room for my wife and me. The bed was very comfortable, and it was great to have a large closet to use during our stay. 

Max and Billie were excellent hosts. Communication was smooth and easy. Check-in was a breeze as well. 

I think you'd be hard pressed to find a better place in London for such a great  price (by London standards). If you're looking for an affordable, comfortable and clean place in London, I'd highly recommend Max and Billie's Notting Hill studio."

24987202,507260154,11/08/2019,90466656,Toby,"As a family of 4, with 2 children and travelling from Yorkshire we were conscious that we’d struggle for space in London. We were very pleasantly surprised at how much space there was in the apartment. Our main needs were separate room for the children so we could have time to ourselves at night without disturbing them. Space for the kids 2 and 6 and a nice clean well presented place to also help us appreciate we were in London travelling for quality family time and also that it was a city break holiday. We enquired about a travel cot and there was no problem, Suzie was an excellent host, quick with communication and always friendly and courteous. 

The photos of the accommodation whilst accurate, don’t do the apartment enough justice in terms of space and how well kept it is, so a great added bonus. The tube is 8 minutes away and a host of local amenities nearby. Would we stay again...yes, in a heartbeat!"

Lucille's house is very beautiful and it's in a super quiet place, without noise and well conected to central London. She was always on hand to make things easier for me: on my arrival, on my return to the airport and during my stay she gave me a lot of information about the places I wanted to go so that everything would be right. The room is plenty of eveything you could need. I've been staying with good hostes but I've never found so many facilities: towels, bathrobe, slippers, hairdryer, all kinds of toiletries, maps, drinks, study utensils, ...she always offers you to make whatever you want for breakfast and a cup of coffe or tea whenever you want, you can leave things in his fridge,. . . . everything great. 
The bed is super comfortable and everything is clean. 
I'm glad to stay with Lucille, a great hostess and a highly recommended place to travel alone and feel safe. When I come back to London, I hope to be able to stay here again, with Lucille and her very very very lovely little dog!!"

Annie and Andrew's delightful home couldn't have suited our needs better.
Perfectly and so conveniently located, walkable to the Tube and buses, to shops, bars and restaurants, not to mention the Thames towpath just on the doorstep. 
Given the extremely busy road just nearby we couldn't believe how quiet our room was, even with a window ajar at night. Our beautifully appointed overlooked their lovely garden. There is currently construction work next door but we were never disturbed by it.
The bed-linen is to die for, we had a wonderful night's sleep. The room is really spacious with plenty of storage and a sofa in it too.
The full English breakfast was sumptuous, home-made, generous with lots of choice too. We didn't need to eat again till the afternoon, it really set us up for the day (and we like to eat!!)

7274152,102378988,18/09/2016,69933098,Darren,"Unusual aircraft activity ? The apartment was lovely and modern and everything was as advertised. Clear directions were received from John which helped greatly to find the apartment. A personal meet from Maxine was also appreciated even though we were delayed in our travels by 3 hours. The only negative we experienced was the constant noise from jet planes which were taking off every 3 minutes from the nearby airport and flying directly overhead the apartment block. We was pleased to find that these did diminish during the night.
Please follow link to see video taken of planes taking off and flying overhead

 (Website hidden by Airbnb) 

I think this may have been unusual activity as when I contacted John he remarked that in 10 years he had never received any negative feedback regarding this so maybe the airport were only temporarily diverting aircraft during our stay. Also the dishwasher was unusable as the door was broken and would not open. If we were considering staying again I would ask in advance if the planes are still flying overhead."

Lyn was a very friendly helpful host and the apartment was comfortable and as described. Lyn's breakfast has been mentioned in other reviews and is a lovely touch.
Lyn also very modestly let it slip that she was voted host of the month for Airbnb in London which says it all
Location is convenient for central London.
Will definitely use again "
5367754,137430292,15/03/2017,77381637,Heather,Gina's place rates in the top of my Airbnb experiences. Her home is beautiful from top to bottom. The pictures and reviews were the reason we chose this place and the home exceeds the pictures. We were in a wonderful neighborhood with great restaurants and cafes. The bus stop is directly across the street or you can walk a very easy couple blocks to the train station.  Gina's communication was excellent and saved us from a tough situation when our original Airbnb fell through less than a day before we landed in London. I am now grateful it did fall through because we couldn't have asked for a better London experience and I would not stay anywhere else the next time we come to London.

We enjoyed our stay however there are a few gripes worth mentioning. The toilet was broken at the top, and it took a while to figure out the best way to flush it, as we didn't want to risk causing more damage. One of the showers also had a broken door, so could not be used. There were also brownish/yellow marks down the side of the walls  that were not picture in the listing photos.  Overall, we had a decent stay, but these structural issues should be taken care of/ or mentioned to visitors beforehand.."

24556181,354853320,02/12/2018,83235174,Guelcan,"Mould near the bed around the radiator, not cleaned at all. Bed linen were not fresh either, was given only one towel that is  not a typical one you would get when renting an accommodation. I went straight up to the host to show her the mould and that I do not feel comfortable and dont find it clean at all. She then let me go as we agreed on a refund, however today I found out through airbnb support that she did not agree to a refund in the end as she thinks the bedroom is ‘clean’ and does not consider the mould as an issue apparently... (I even took pics) I would not usually leave a bad review, however, the fact that she does not admit it and still thinks it is normal to have the bedroom in that state and rejected a refund to airbnb support  made me do it.. shocking.. please be careful, this is not the cleanest bedroom you would get."

The host, Myriam, and her hosting company were very responsive throughout and quickly helped to rectify the situation. The heating in main room it turns out is broken and the kitchen is not well equipped for cooking meals. But after we found how to turn heating and boiler on, there was good hot water and the heating from the rest of the flat kept the main room warm. 
The apartment overall very clean, some of Myriam's personal belongings are around but carefully placed out of the way. A quiet and safe place to stay after unavoidable work kept me away from home for a few days."

But she was there, smiling and waiting for us! We always have had quick answers when we contacted her, and she received us with a considerable number of amenities that turned into a very nice welcome reception: snacks, goodies in the fridge and so. Her home is what we expect from a London home (as we see in the movies and so), but so much bigger than it seems by the AirBNB photos. It's very spacious, with comfortable rooms and a beautiful/modern kitchen. The neighborhood is very silent and her street is totally residential, very homy. Two blocks away, the subway/tube. One block away: an excellent supermaket, restaurants, a pub, shops and even a movie theatre. I had to buy an AC adapter for the AC outlet, and found it one block away in an electrical goods store.

However, the night I took that Airbnb it was really cool outside and the heating was dysfunctional. Without the heater, it really feels like you are sleeping on the street. There was a small heater in that room that randomly activates and desactivates, and any attempt to get another one from the reception was infructuous. Through the night, temperature kept changing from sauna to ice cold, which resulted in the worst flu I had in years... Would absolutely not recommend when it's cold outside."

Responses from Billie to a couple of maintenance issues were very speedy, friendly and efficient. I also appreciated being able to leave my luggage somewhere after check-out before my evening flight.

As mentioned in other reviews, the studio is small. We stayed for a week and there was very little storage space/ shelving for my husband and I to unpack our cases and feel comfortable, eg. no shelving in the bathroom or in the shower so you have to keep everything on the floor! Also, we are both tall and found the bed too small for us (it’s a small double)."

42950585,738256330,12/03/2021,46331457,Kyle,I understand this was a budget accommodation but the issues were easily preventable. The kitchen and bathroom were so incredibly dirty. Dishes sat in the sink for days from other roommates and they left countertops dirty. I was only able to shower half the time bc the hot water didn’t always work. My bedroom door didn’t have a door knob and instead I had to put a weight behind the door to close it.

2839143,21036692,10/10/2014,20726960,Bonny,"I traveled to Europe for 2 weeks with one of my best friends.  London was our first stop with 4 nights at Davey's flat in Greenwich. Davey allowed us to check in a bit early and even met us a few blocks away and helped with luggage.  The flat is lovely, squeaky clean and exactly as pictured.  Amenities are as noted and Dave spent time going over everything, keys, appliances, shower, wi-fi passwords, local recommendations and more.  And he had snacks on hand for us, milk,  juices and fresh flowers.  So nice of him!

While a bit outside Central London, Greenwich is charming, walkable and a great place to relax after a busy day in the City.   We often took the Thames Clipper which got us into the City in 20 minutes, and the DLR was less than 2 minutes away.   Greenwich has an abundance of restaurants and shops.  It was great to do some food shopping and make our own breakfasts.

I can highly recommend Davey's flat."

5000458,33385386,27/05/2015,32193692,Tomas,"Wir genossen sehr den Aufenthalt in dem B&B von Sally und Sean. Vom ersten Augenblick an fühlten wir uns herzlich aufgenommen und ganz und gar wie zu Hause. Jeden Morgen wurde uns ein liebevoll zubereitetes Frühstück mit immer frischem Obst kredenzt und es war auch jedes Mal ein Vergnügen, sich mit unseren beiden Gastgebern zu unterhalten. (Sean mit seinen stets ironischen Kommentaren.) Auf all unsere Fragen suchten sie hilfsbereit immer gleich eine Antwort. Ihr Haus wie das Zimmer gefielen uns sehr, wohl kaum ein Hotel kann diesen Komfort bieten. Anfangs waren wir zwar erschrocken darüber, dass die Bahn so nahe hinter dem Haus vorbei fährt, denn wir beide sind sehr lärmempfindlich, (Sally erwähnt dies ausdrücklich im Profil, aber ich hatte es überlesen) Doch aus einem nicht erklärbaren Grund (Feng Shui?) schliefen wir bei offenem Fenster und ohne Ohrstöpsel ganz wunderbar. So ist unsere einzige Sorge, dass wir Sallys und Seans Gastfreundschaft nicht ein weiteres Mal genießen können, weil sie bei all diesen Lobpreisungen hoffnungslos ausgebucht sein werden. 

We enjoyed our delightful stay at Sally’s and Sean’s House very much. From the first moment we felt us warmly welcome and like at home. Breakfast was always prepared lovingly with fresh fruits. And we loved to talk with Sally and Sean (his always ironic comments). If we had any question, they tried to find an answer. House and room are charming. And yes, train is passing behind the garden like Sally wrote in their profile. I don’t know why, perhaps some miraculous Feng Shui, because normally we both are sound-sensitive, but we slept with open window and no earplugs absolutely well. Our only fear is, that with all this praising comments, that Sally and Sean will be always booked out. And we really, really want to come back once more.

–  in breve: un splendido B&B, Sally and Sean sono tutto i due ospiti molto cordiali. Merveilleux et magnifique cet B&B et Sally et Sean, le deux hôtes aussi  – nádherný B&B. A veľmi pekné, príjemné hostiteľa.–

1635433,279722163,21/06/2018,35986692,Michelle,"Vito's place was small but well laid out. The rooftop deck more than made up for any lack of space. There was unprecedented heat in London while we were here and it was really lovely to hang out up there--and when the door to the deck was open, it also helped to cool things down a bit. The bed was quite firm. 
I think the flat is perfect for one or two people who will share the bed. Our son slept in the living room and he had some trouble sleeping as we had to leave the windows open due to the heat, and there was some noise on the street below. It is the high street after all... I think if windows could be closed, that problem might be solved. 
Communication and check-in were both excellent. Vito was also really flexible with us on timing for check out as we needed a bit of extra time.
All in all a good experience."

Et gros bonus : un matelas fantastique. La cuisine est très bien fournie, avec un peu de chance  vous goûterez les délicieux biscuits fait maison de Lucile. Quant à la maison, d'une manière générale, elle est très chaleureuse, située dans une rue calme et sécurisée, à deux pas d'un grand parc et de tous les commerces. En moins de 20 minutes de bus -selon le trafic, ligne 77-, vous êtes à Westminster. 
Bref, je recommande à 100%."
5569438,330101905,30/09/2018,16063380,Chandeep,"Sian’s place is perfect if you want to explore Central London. It’s in a prime location not far from Regents Park, Marylebone and Baker Street areas. It’s a cute place with a double bed and a double sofa-bed, ideal for a family, a couple or a small group of friends. It was easy to keep in touch with Sian beforehand and also on the day during the lead up to check-in. The photos of the bathroom in this AirBnB make it look narrow, when in fact the bathroom is spacious and roomy. I would highly recommend staying here - very well hosted by Sian."

This flat was beyond superb. Super simple to check in with Eliza. I absolutely loved the atmosphere it created while I stayed in London. This was truly a home away from home. I’d be more than happy to return here and stay in the future."

We stayed for 2 weeks and loved it.  We were very fortunate to meet Max in person and he is a very nice host.  We explained a few issues we had had with the managing agents and Max said he will sort these out so that future guests don’t have the same problems.  Thank you Max!"

Peter was really communicative and that helped so much as it allowed me to know exactly what I needed to do and when. Although I wasn't at the apartment for a long time, thoroughly enjoyed my stay and was made comfortable the entire time. Peter took my booking at short notice, so to get anything this nice was a nice surprise. 

Thanks again Peter,

19670926,588292013,04/01/2020,65488985,Kartik,"The place is hardly 3 mins walk from Aldgate East station. There is a coffee shop on ground floor where you can get basic breakfast and there is a restaurant at 1st floor. If you like to cook your own food, Tesco (super market) is 4 mins walk from the place where u would hey everything that you may need to cook. The room are actually smaller that it appears in the picture but they are good enough for 2 people. It's a studio format and nice cozy place. The staff at reception is very helpful and responsive and also helped me getting an hour early check in.
Its becomes little expensive for short stays as service fees were higher but if youare staying for a week, it's good value for money. My stay was very comfortable."
7333979,358389289,14/12/2018,146053010,Maria,"Anna’s place felt like home away from home during my stay over 3 weeks. I was in London for work and Anna’s apartment was clean, nice and cozy, with a comfy bed in the room that can be extended to a double one if you need to, a wardrobe and plenty of books. The private bathroom is new and with that kind of shower/bathhub from which you would like not to get out anymore. The kitchen comes with all what you need for meal prep.  Maida Vale is a lovely and quite neighbourhood and 5 minutes walk away from the tube. With the bakerloo line you have a fast connection to the city center. I did not meet Anna but communication with her was always fast and uncomplicated and her friend who takes care of the place when she is away is absolutely friendly and helpful. Well...I’ll make sure her place is available the next time I need to come to London!"

But unfortunately it’s very very small,  I can stand and touch both walls at the same time.  The bathroom is connected too the kitchen, that’s also then living room.

The best way too describe the property, it’s laid out like living on a barge/canal boat.

Unfortunately for the cost, the place just isn’t large enough to be value for  money."

She gave us a lot of local tips and the free breakfast provided was delicious. She and her partner reacted quickly to the small problems, such as heating (modifying the start hours). UK adapters for the sockets were provided too :) Even though we didn't met Emma in person, everything was fine and we would totally recommend her place for a nice stay in London."

It was quiet; we slept like babies. Best of all, I love the neighborhood!  There are many good restaurants in a variety of price ranges, a good supermarket, safe, paved running trails in parks, and the Camberwell Leisure Center with workout gym and 25 meter pool with lap lanes was free for the first visit -- all this within a five minute walk! Yet it's a very quiet neighborhood. No tube access, but there's an above-ground station and buses to the center city are plentiful. "

My husband and I recently stayed at the flat for 4 weeks over the Xmas period. It was spacious, warm and you couldn't ask for a better location - once settled in we were very comfortable. During our lengthy stay there were a few things that needed to be fixed, such as the ensuite shower, but our super host, Alessandro and his assistant, Carol were always  available and super efficient in resolving our concerns. We couldn't recommend them more highly. An extra special effort was made by our host to put us in the Xmas spirit. We were given a beautiful, large Xmas tree and new in box decorations that were truly much appreciated. The gift of the Australian red wine that awaited our arrival was also a nice touch. We can't say enough how supportive, generous and responsive Alessandro and Carol were at all times, especially in assisting our son's departure after we had left. We always find the best way to gauge our holiday experience is to ask ourselves:  ""Would we return?""  In this instance our answer is: Yes, you bet!"

And yes, lots of steps on that staircase too, but the building is handsome and not at all in a seedy area.  Being in the literal heart of London saved me so much to-and-fro time for other activities.  Would stay with Ruth again in a heartbeat!"

Although it's a small space, the amenities were complete. What's more, it is in a very accessible neighborhood with a lot of places for food and groceries. Just note that you will need to climb a few flights of narrow stairs to get to the flat,  so not ideal for those travelling with bulky and heavy luggages."

As lovely as the photographs are, they do not do justice to the beauty of Vanessa's house. The room was beautifully decorated and impeccably clean and the area is very tranquil. I really enjoyed exploring the area, and it proved to be a great base for exploring the wider city. I cannot recommend Vanesa's place highly enough."

My room was a wonderful spa like retreat after a long trip back from Paris. It was spotless, the linens were very nice and having a television in the room was great as well. I thoroughly enjoyed having my own ensuite bathroom and a long soak in the wonderful ensuite garden tub. Being able to walk downstairs and have a quick breakfast before heading out was such a convenience. Vesna and her husband will help you in any way they can, giving advice, directions, etc. The room allows you to look it with your own key so that you don't need to worry about your belongings while you are out. There is complete privacy if you want it as well. I thoroughly enjoyed my time spent in her home, I only wish I could have stayed longer but I most definitely will consider staying there again when back in London. Thank you Vesna and Michael for being such wonderful hosts.  "

Very clean and huge comfortable bed. The room isn't minimalist but very cosy and feels like home. The access to the patio is nice. Lindsay is a very gracious host. Invisible and quiet in the house, but always there to help. The whole setting up and organisation, keys etc was smooth. Hardly ever saw her two cats and the house definitely doesn't seem to host pets.
Lindsay let me bring my cat during the stay and the room was big enough for her to feel at ease. 
The location is convenient and quiet.Tesco 1min away. 10min walk to get to the overground.
Would come back anytime and be happy to stay there again! Thanks for the stay!"

Laura welcomed us and explained us everything about the house and she also gave us some pieces of helpfull advice of how to move in that enourmous city. She is a very nice person and she offers you all.  The room is very confortable and you can make use of every room in the house; kitchen, living, patio. Although there are other housemates we never had any problem to use the bathroom.
The neighbourhood is very quiet and near Laura´s house there are many shops where you can find everything from food to clothes.
The bus stop to go to the city centre is very close as well as the train station.
I really recommend it!!"

I'd had to move from a nearby hotel that turned out to be quite unclean and unpleasant, so when I arrived at Elena's I was overjoyed to find how perfect it was for what I needed. The room has a comfy double bed, useful kitchenette and desk with a supportive chair. The bathroom is gorgeous, and I really enjoyed being able to have a relaxing bath after a long day at work! Elena responded really quickly to everything, and even left me goodies in the fridge and cupboards which was much appreciated! The house is right next to the A3, but this room faces the back of the house and I never noticed the road noise with the windows closed at night.

There is a grocery next door and every type of shop, restaurant and even great music venues. It's 20 minutes into central London on the tube, so a great place to stay out of the fray, but close enough to everything you want to see. She has a comfortable bed, good heating, adequate kitchen facilities and a  good quality shower. There is a washing machine and ironing  in the apartment as well. Communication was good and entry was easy. We would recommend this listing highly. 
My only cautionary advise is that there is a long stairway of about 2 flights to the apartment which presented no problem to us, but would be prohibitive to some guests who have issues ascending stairs or carrying luggage. 
The following comment is not a complaint at all, but do bring all your own toiletries and a hair dryer if you use one and paper products will help, although there are great towels and dishcloths and starter toilet tissue and a market and atm within steps."

We enjoyed our stay - very convenient for the Northern line and well connected with buses to the city and Hampstead Heath, Camden Town - bus stops/tube stations are all within 5-10min walk. Beautiful surrounding area and lovely cafes and restaurants. There is a Tesco extra nearby. Neel provided a fan for the hot weather which was a welcomed relief.  Wifi was excellent. There is a lovely communal garden to enjoy. Would recommend to others."

772992,30145505,18/04/2015,1042726,Frances,"Toral was the best Airbnb host I've had to date! She was so friendly and welcoming. She wasn't there when I arrived but made checking in seamless, from advising on how to get to her place to leaving me the key. The bedroom and bathroom were pristine and just as the listing described. Bermondsey is such a cool neighborhood with quirky little shops and a bunch of great restaurants, and it's a quick walk to the tube. The Thames, Tower Bridge, Millennium Bridge, the Tate Modern (Toral even let me borrow her membership!), and so many other places you want to visit are in walking distance. Toral also cooked a delicious, healthy breakfast each morning—talk about going above and beyond. Lastly, she was such a great resource on how I should plan my day, and I even got the chance to go to Borough Market with her and meet her favorite vendors. Thanks again, Toral, and hope to stay with you the next I'm in London!"

Wynn wasn't there himself but made sure everything was fine. Very handy to have a private toilet. We couldn't leave our bag after checking out because the apartment was booked for the next day, but I'm sure Wynn would have let us otherwise. If you're heavily pregnant and a side sleeper (specific, I know) you might find the mattress too hard, but I managed with all the extra pillows available! Overall a great stay!"

It was totally great room in London. The location is close to the cental places of London. ( you can walk for only 6 min from the house to bus station) If you have a oyster card, I strongly recommend to stay here. Also You can have your own privacy peacefully and use shower room & toilet at anytime. And there are lots of amenities like cozy hotel! It goes without saying that I will book this place again for visiting London :)"
14794460,606411412,16/02/2020,25448515,Ly,Julias place has everything I need for my trip and I appreciate her quick response. Eventhough the bathroom in the 2nd floor is a little bit small but I'm fine with it. Her place locates in zone 2 of London but you can easily travel to the city central with the underground trains that depart every few minutes.

The building was very quiet, comfortable, and easy to find. I walked everywhere because of the perfect location. Alex even had adapters in the wall for those that may have forgotten theirs. Everything about my stay there was better then expected, and I wouldn't change a thing. I would stay there again in in a heartbeat, and suggest no one pass it up.

It's very difficult to feel like home when you're away, but Assen made it possible the two times he hosted us, and if its possible, there will be more absolutely for sure. Again: PERFECT."

The location could't be better, it's half way the Heathrow airport and Central London, all using the Picadilly underground line (only 2 blocks away). Paul was always around and he was extremely nice to us, he let us leave the luggage after checking out since we left London in a late flight.

The flat was located in a beautiful section of South Kensington on a wide street lined with gorgeous gardens. We felt at home in the flat which was very spacious. The high cathedral ceilings along with tall glass widows drew in a lot of light during the day and gave us a beautiful view of our garden out back. The bed rooms were also very comfortable. The remainder of the living space was also accommodating with a comfortable living room, kitchen and dining area. Several amenities including cable TV and Wifi were also included. The location allowed for short walks to Kensington Gardens, great local restaurants, bars and the Gloucester Street Tube station for easy access to other sections of London and beyond. 

The owner, Florence and her family, Penny and Freddie were very very nice and available in the event we needed any assistance. 
If you are looking to stay in London at a great location with easy access to all the great London sites that's safe and comfortable at a reasonable cost, 21 Cranley Gardens is the place to stay. "

1274276,112523914,06/11/2016,51253339,Caitlin,"Tabitha and Dan were excellent hosts. Tabi was extremely communicative (better than (Hidden by Airbnb) when it came providing directions from the airport!), and both had plenty of advice on things to do during my stay. The wifi was strong and the bed was comfy. If you're visiting London to conduct research at Kew and SOAS (like me), I'd definitely recommend this place. "

10761622,573425930,06/12/2019,517242,Selcuk,"Great location from my point of view because it was in the middle of the design world of London. Its a stones throw away from the west end. And the flat, was great. Just what I needed."
6194112,98443544,31/08/2016,1433268,Karin,"Since we had such a good time last year we decided to book John's apartment again. It felt like coming home. It's such a nice place, fully equipped, the neighbourhood is nice (there is a very nice Portugese restaurant which also serves English breakfast around the corner). We took the 87er bus to directly go to Westminster Abbey and all the other sightseeing highlights. It's very cosy and there's no traffic noise at all. All in all - perfect!"

The building seems to be quite old and Bethia has preserved the original charm of the flat while adding beautiful artistic touches to make it her own!  In a great area, there's a market just next door and the homerton overground is around the corner maybe a 5 minute walk.  It's easy to get into the city but also not too close and is quite quiet at night.  Great location and Bethia was so kind and accommodating.  "

19670926,724343664,15/01/2021,139133162,Michael,"The check in was awful, so what happened to me was I booked a room for two nights on Airbnb’s and when I got there the staff wasn’t really friendly anyway also the room I got wasn’t the one I booked on Airbnb’s so I went to the reception and told the staff the room wasn’t the one I booked and the answer was, oh sorry the particular type of room that you have booked is full so we can only give you this one and I was like what? Because the one I have booked is a bigger room and the one she give to me was a smaller room also when I booked it no one told me the room was full or anything, and then I have discussed with her and she said ok she can give me another one (literally the same room that I booked but in a high floor) and she ask me to pay extra £20 for it!! the reason she give it to me was because this one is on a different floor and I was like?? Why? That’s the same room I have booked online and I have paid that particular room just because you give my room to someone else and now you give me the same room in a different floor so I have to pay extra £20? Anyways in the end I was not happy at all the stuff wasn’t friendly as well."

This is clearly his home and although we didn't meet he made us feel very welcome.  This included a welcome note and breakfast supplies.

Another great Airbnb experience."

ich war schon einige male in einer Air BNB, diese hier war mit Abstand ein Horrortrip.
Angefangen hat es damit, dass als wir abends als es schon dunkel war angekommen sind und das Licht in unserem Raum nicht funktionierte. Nach 1h warten kam dann jemand um es auszutauschen, bzw. musste die Glühbirne erst noch gekauft werden, weshalb wir weitere 30 min im dunklen saßen und nicht loskonnten.
Die Dusche hat Schimmel, das WC ekelhafte braune und gelbe flecken und allgemein ‚mieft‘ es ziemlich im Bad.
Anstelle 2 Handtüchern pro Person (groß und klein) bekommt man nur eines, das Klopapier war während unseres Aufenthaltes leer und wurde nicht nachgefüllt.
Auch das Schloss unseres Zimmers war kaputt, weshalb wir unsere Sachen bei 8 weiteren Fremden Gästen nicht einschließen konnten.
Die antworten des Hosts auf Mängelhinweise waren schon nahe zu unverschämt. 
Wirklich enttäuschend und nicht zu empfehlen."

Bathroom always very clean. Clean towels and duvet always available.

Excellent WiFi. 
A very quite place.

20313341,284134244,01/07/2018,93347348,Sarah,"We had an amazing time staying at Eddies. There were a lot of great points but most notable were: 

- easy location on the Piccadilly Line with a short walk that we enjoyed everyday and easily accessible with buses as well 
- great Turkish food 5 mins away that we visited several nights for dinner 
- there may be other guests sharing the apartment (in the other room) but we never found this an issue - in fact we loved having breakfast each morning with two lovely German women staying at the same time 
- Eddie respects your privacy but is also very helpful if you need anything, he let us use the washing machine and printed several things we needed - this saved our butts! 
- he also kindly offers a free breakfast, it is simple but was great for us to have a good start to the day, 

Would definitely stay at Eddie’s again. "

306966,77682980,02/06/2016,1488780,Claudia,"I spent 3 months in Sam's apartment.  When I arrived, I was greeted by a friend of Sam's and she helped me get settled.  There was enough fresh milk, fresh fruit, cereals, eggs, etc. to make a nice breakfast, so I didn't have to rush out to shop.  There was shampoo and body wash, too.  

The apartment is very nicely located off of Edgware Road.  There is a bus stop right in front of the building and a couple of Metro stations a few blocks in either direction.  It is very close to Hyde Park and a stroll across the park will find you either at Kensington Palace or the Museums along Exhibition Road (Science, Natural History and the Victoria and Albert).  

The apartment was clean and kept clean with a cleaning person every two weeks.  I slept well on the bed.  It faces off of the main road, so the city noise was not bad for the convenience of the location.  The kitchen was upgraded just before I arrived and now includes stone counter tops, a nice cook surface and oven, washer/dryer combination and dishwasher.  The bathroom was luxurious with a jetted tub AND a television that you can watch while you soak away the day!  Loved the bathroom!  

I found the living/sitting room space poorly allocated.  The large (and rather uncomfortable) leather sectional takes up the WHOLE space.  If Sam would get a new, normal-sized couch or get rid of two sections of the couch, there would be room to set up the folding table as a place to eat (currently you must eat on the couch) or use as a make-shift desk.  I've told Sam that this really needs improvement.

Sam was kind and pleasant.  He was very responsive to my needs.  I enjoyed our interactions and hope we will keep in touch.  "
12302679,440206878,20/04/2019,189455305,Maddy,Peter’s home was lovely and exactly what we needed for a room to sleep in. For any tall people the stairs to get to the kitchen probably aren’t for you. But if you’re only there to sleep like we were the room is perfect and spacious for 2 people. Peter was very responsive and kind and had a fabulous experience at his home!

L'appartement de Diana se situe dans un immeuble de briques rouges, on y accède par une coursive extérieure typique. Il est entouré de verdure et offre une luminosité incroyable. Le lit est d'un confort exceptionnel, le linge de qualité, bref, ce que vous offre l'appartement de Diana s'est un sentiment d'être à la maison.
Les transports. Le métro n'est pas au pied de l'immeuble mais deux stations sont très facilement accessibles, et une multitude de lignes de bus vous transportent dans le centre de Londres.

Keep in mind that it's a residential neighbourhood, though, and that it's not as fancy as central London. Anyway, the room was clean, nicely decorated and everything we needed was there: towels, kettle, tea, sheets, etc. Finally, the host was nice and everything went smoothly so I recommand this place to anybody who wants to stay in London and is looking for a simple room that's not too expansive. 
Thanks again!"

The place was super clean and the neighborhood had all the best spots for food, bars, coffee shops, and some cute shops too.  To let people know (wasn’t much of an issue for my sister and I but...) it is above a very loud club that is open to the early AMs on the weekend. Also sweltering during the summer when we would return to the flat from being out all day but the windows were easy to work with and cooled the apartment down very quickly once opened. Would definitely stay here again!"

Reachable by train and 15 mins away from Hounslow Central. Very close to the airport and convenient, but if you are flying out or in with luggage; taxi is better option to reach there. Can't beat the price to value ratio. Being close to the airport also means you hear the plains if the windows are open..."

It is not a typical Richmond address and the front and back gardens are far from inviting, they are unkempt and neglected and there's rubbish bins lining the front pathway. 'Beautiful apartment in a quiet residential area.' is not correct. The description doesn't mention the constant noise from the Flight path with aeroplanes coming in to land over head from 5.30am.  The floor mattress has been flattened with overuse and needs to be replaced."

There was an issue with two of the rooms getting switched up, but Jubel was quick to help us out. The people staying in the other room were loud and left the kitchen dirty,  which wasn’t great. Luckily someone came and cleaned almost every day, so it wasn’t too much of an issue. Overall, a good stay!"

TV did not work and has not been fixed despite several requests. Water of the shower was boiling which made any showers very difficult and curtain in the living room was broken (which made the flat very dark). Kitchen equipment is quite good and linen and towels are clean and fresh. Could have been better if all equipment worked and host more reactive to solve the issues.

503151,179738109,08/08/2017,39304972,Mengya,"Karen's apartment is in very good location. There are tube and bus stations within walking distance. The apartment is trendy and our room is clean. We have never met Karen in person but she's responsive via airbnb. During our stay, Karen's daughter lived in the house, and we are kinda avoiding each other which was totally fine, although one day we saw some unexpected stuff in the toilet. All in all, Karen's apartment is worth recommending. It's cool, clean, good location, you can even do laundry. Nice stay."

Very close to a metro station. The room is spacious and clean with a comfortable king-sized bed. Our stay in her place was perfect.

11051591,226373450,10/01/2018,161386973,Clarissa,"Die Lage der Unterkunft ist super. Die Bushaltestelle ist in weniger als 5min erreichbar. Von dort aus fahren sehr viele Busse in das Zentrum von London. Supermärkte gibt es auch sehr viele (empfehlen kann ich den Tesco Express bei Elephant and Castle, denn da gibts leckere Zimtschnecken für 1Pfund! :) )Wir hatten eine schöne Zeit hier in London sowie auch bei Mo. Er ist sehr sehr freundlich und will nur das Beste für seine Gäste. Wir haben uns sehr wohlgefühlt und würde auch ein zweites Mal die Unterkunft buchen. Das Zimmer war sauber und man bekam sogar Handtücher von Mo. In der Unterkunft ist es etwas hellhöhrig, das könnte den ein oder anderen stören. Da wir jedoch den ganzen Tag dirch London rumgelaufen sind, waren wir so müde, dass es uns egal war. :) 

Super Unterkunft - sehr zu empfehlen!"
28881462,504914089,08/08/2019,183702519,Kaetlyn,"Didn’t ever meet Nade but her husband was accommodating and to the point. The room is huge and bright. Could have done without having to go upstairs to use the toilet/shower, but overall a very clean and cheap place to stay that still wasn’t too far from public transport to get into the city."
31470133,508702577,13/08/2019,201754163,Şenay,"The room was mostly fine and fairly large by London standards. There is a useful fridge in the room and a well-equipped kitchen downstairs. The location is a quiet residential area. It's well-connected by public transport, although it's about a 10-15 minute walk from Queensway station on the Bakerloo line. You can get a bus more quickly by walking a few minutes towards Maida Hill - you can get a number 36 bus for example from the bus stop at Elgin Ave. to Marble Arch or Victoria station. The street layout can be a little confusing though, so make sure you have some sort of phone map available.

The main issue we had with this stay was that the host was initially not as responsive as they could be. They could greatly improve their guests' experience by more promptly providing check-in information etc."
439489,114769143,20/11/2016,55418825,Kristen,"I stayed at James's place while visiting a friend at the Royal Central School of Speech and Drama. James's place is centrally located in Primrose Hill, a residential neighborhood in North London, and it was perfect for my needs. It is very close to the Swiss Cottage tube station, which is on the Jubilee line and can get you quickly to anywhere you want to go in central London. I had lived in London for a few months once before, so I wasn't really concerned with sightseeing during my stay, but the access to public transportation is great and you should not have a problem seeing the sights, if that's what you're looking to do! James is a very attentive host and will help you find anything you might be looking for in the city!  "

Clean, tidy and everything there for you.
Check-in perfect
Room perfect
Own bathroom and shower of excellent quality
Towels blankets tea coffee facilities everything you need
Reda is obviously knowledgeable on local area, trains, and facilities which is really helpful,  so am I now 
I always have a good chat with Reda about life in general, but if you want to just have privacy that's  fine too

Very good value for money

I'll be back, if it's not booked up "

17005261,469356496,14/06/2019,2439092,Kinsley,"The pictures are a bit deceiving, in that the room and the apartment are a bit shabbier than the photos suggest.  However, the location cannot be beat. You hop on the train and are literally at Victoria Station in 3 minutes. It was easy and quick to get around London. Ultimately it was what I needed for my quick trip!"
1266880,30283306,20/04/2015,19633430,Jessie,Susannah and Ben's apartment was wonderful! The decor was fantastic and the amenities plentiful.

22662581,483064192,07/07/2019,2544398,Cat & Mike,We had a fantastic stay and in Jess’s apartment. It’s only 10 minutes away from some great bars and restaurants in Peckham and has good transport links into central London. The apartment is cosy and has everything you would need for a short or long stay. Jess was easy to contact and gave us some good recommendations on places to eat and drink in the area. The apartment is also extremely affordable compared to other listings we looked at. Thanks for having us!

4553443,86810669,17/07/2016,16155277,Antonia,"We stayed for a long weekend at the place and it wass good. The room was clean and tidy with a shared bathroom, which was kept pretty ok considering how shared bathrooms usually are. We did not use the shared kitchen, but it seemed to be well equipped. The neighborhood seemed a little shady but you are out of it within a 15min walk. London bridge is within walking distance (about 15-20min) and public transport is super close (bus and trains). Kamal was welcoming and friendly and gabe us tips on dining opportunities. We would come back."

599058,175904977,30/07/2017,44470154,Lorraineb,"The flat itself was lovely and very clean, however we found it very noisy until we discovered that there was another sliding window across the wooden window that actually blocks out the noise at night.   Very central and within walking distance to most places of interest.  Buy a weekly ticket at the station that enables you to hop off and on any bus or train in Zones 1 & 2."

Kiki made us feel welcome, from all the messages exchanged before our stay, to detailed instructions as to how to get there as well as lots of recommendations for places to eat and drink. The room was bright, clean and really comfortable with tea and coffee making facilities and a bathroom next door. We loved the proximity of Kiki's place to Camden and the local pubs and restaurants, it was an easy walk to everything we needed. We will definitely stay here again, if Kiki will have us!"

Was very easy to communicate with and fast to reply with any queries. The flat was homely and loved my stay there. Had everything I needed in the flat. The pub at the end of the road had AMAZING roast carvery everyday! Overall would stay here again and would recommend it to anyone.

The home is located in very nice neighborhood in Ham.  It is three levels with large kitchen / dining / common area on first floor and a secluded well landscaped back yard.

Close to some food and shopping options.  Love the cat, Ginger - very affectionate - likes to hang out on your lap.

Two minor cons - in March - the place was always cold, even with the heat on, it never really seemed to get warm.  But I'm sure in the summer that's a positive not a negative.  And many mornings a combination of birds, neighborhood cats and Ginger made it hard to sleep past 7."

We mostly walked into and around the city, but the bus stop was a 2 minute walk from the appartment, nice and close, along with some cafes and a grocery store - so it was conviently placed. 
The appartment is fairly simple but has everything we needed. It was clean and tidy. The beds were comfortable. Definately would reccommend staying with Aga. :-)"

The view is stunning indeed, the apartment is modern, super clean, overall comfortable and cosy. Tracey was extremely fast in replying, she was very nice and I was able to check in early after a tiring early bus ride to London. Lovely personal touch with water, biscuits and even Oyster cards. The location is perfect, close to Paddington, 25 min walk to Oxford Street and Hyde Park. Bus service and subway next to the block, very close to Little Venice for a charming breakfast on the canal. Overall, 10 out of 10 would recommend. Did I mention the view from the apartment is amazing?! You can see the whole of London, sunrise on Shard and London Eye in the evening. Looking forward to a summer stay at Tracey’s place:)"

La dipendente di LDG, molto competente e carina, ci ha esposto in modo esaustivo la casa. 
Il prezzo era un po' alto per 3 giorni, ma in ogni caso in linea con i prezzi di Londra. Probabilmente abbiamo pagato molto per la posizione dell'appartamento. 

Molto soddisfatta."

The host was present when we arrived by chance so we had some nice small talk and she was friendly, but you can also check in yourself. The only thing I was a little confused about was the lack of door to the top floor studio, and no blinds on two small slanted windows which made it a bit hot, but these were very minor issues personally."

Condo was a good value and exactly as described.  Great location on the Thames and right next door to tube, bus and train stations.   Large complex, shiny and new.  Tesco express in complex is incredibly handy and a full size supermarket is three blocks away.  Solid and quick wifi for uploading pictures in the evening.  All things considered, a very good value.

The room he provides was great (full access to kitchen and some breakfast foods, room has a tv with cable and Netflix). We went during a heat wave and our room was unbearably hot not aided by the dryer running during these hot days across from our bedroom (the room had a fan).  One negative note,  he had difficulty keeping up with the laundry, there was often piles of clothes on the bathroom floor and banister and our towels were damp for quite a while. Otherwise a wonderful visit!"

The house was super easy to find using the detailed description Amelie provided. Her place is very central to all local attractions as well as being close to the tube meaning travelling from/to central London was very easy. 
The room itself was perfect for my short stay and having access to your own bathroom and shower room is a real treat. I was made to feel very welcome, I’d happily stay with Amelie and her family again should the opportunity arise."

The studio was very very close to the underground.  The neighborhood was busy with shopping and restaurants.  The space of the studio was comfortable and exactly what we needed to enjoy a few nights in London."
21761267,460490002,29/05/2019,247483651,Michael,"Could not ask for anything more. The hosts were great in being very accommodating, welcoming, and warm. Gave insight and pointers that were very much appreciated when asked. Being honest: the hospitality of the gracious hosts far exceeded what I needed, but was extended regardless and made me feel much more welcome. The place was clean, comfortable, and safe. Location was right next to transit which made visiting all so much more enjoyable and convenient. Look forward to a future stay if welcomed."

25559887,317477702,02/09/2018,52036683,Alex,"Nice little hotel, it's 1* hotel so understanding that the bar is low, it's pretty good. 
I found some things funny like:
- you need to leave a $5 deposit for the remote :) not a big deal b/c I don't watch TV just funny.
- there are no USB plugs, and there are no US/Euro sockets, all are british 3 square pin ones which you need an adopter
- closet had no doors. Again, who really cares, but it's funny

Location is great, checkin easy, room is tiny but clean, and so is the bathroom. Nice little shower area too. High ceilings which is nice but I guess pretty standard in london. 

Overall, I liked it, good value"

Avant d'effectuer la réservation, nous avons re-demandé confirmation par SMS et nous avons bien eu la confirmation de Marian. 

Arrivés sur place : 
1. Pas de Marian mais c'est Carole qui gère les lieux.
2. Pas de parking gratuit.

Egalement, nous avons réservé la chambre avec 6 lits et avons donc payé le tarif qui va avec même si nous n'étions plus que 5 dans la chambre à partir de la 2e nuit.
Et nous nous sommes retrouvés la 2e nuit avec une jeune femme qui a été déplacée d'une autre chambre dans laquelle elle avait dormi déjà 2 nuits ! Tout celà pour gérer l'urgence selon Carole (un problème de synchronisation entre les réservations Airbnb et Booking). Nous sommes OK pour ""gérer l'urgence"" et accueillir une personne dans notre chambre pour dépanner mais ceci doit se traduire par un remboursement de trop perçu car nous avons payé pour ce lit et la jeune femme également. Jamais reçu de remboursement.

Je tiens quand même à préciser que nous avons pu trouver un arrangement avec Carole pour laisser notre véhicule en bas de la maison. Nous avons donc finalement pu bénéficier du parking gratuit et, en finalité, le séjour de 3 jours s'est bien déroulé..."

His place is beautiful and stylish. The bedroom and apartment is exactly as described if not better! He’s such a great host, so welcoming and gave really good tips to explore London.

There is a bus you can get into city but for the main attractions you need to change the bus or walk to tower hill then there is famous no.15 bus to Trafalga square. It is a pleasant walk though to Tower hill walking along the St. Katherine Dock area. Big Waitrose is just 3 mins away so you can get your all things you need for daily necessities. Easy check in and check out. Plus, Anaroly is vwey responsive. I would stay Anatoly's place again for sure!"

He made sure we had a smooth transition into the house and he was super helpful by being flexible with our check-in and check-out times. The place was just as pictured and we had a very comfortable stay. The house was a bit further out of the hustle and bustle of London, but we liked it that way.

Deux adultes avec deux jeunes filles (16 e 21 ans), c'était un peu juste pour une durée d'une semaine, mais quand même confortable.
Littéralement à 7 minutes d'une station de train-Overgroud-Underground, dans un cartier tranquille, nous étions prêt de tout en moins de 30 minutes (sauf pour Harry Potter, mais sur la ligne directe en 45 minutes!!).
Bref je recommande sans hésiter de louer cet appartement. Et dès que je retourne à Londres, je recontacte Anne-Marie!"

Sadly the host was unavailable to let me upon arrival and to introduce me to the space. I discovered the room and bedding to not be in a state of cleanliness I would have expected. I contacted the host and he replied telling my where to find new bedsheets which I fitted myself. The host did phone me later to check in which was good of him. 

Generally the place in my view wasn’t clean. Plus there was no milk to make a hot drink when I got in from a full days work. 

Location was good, but overall at this price point I was expecting much better unfortunately. 

The space is of good size so hopefully the host can turn this into a great listing for the future. "

I received the specific check-in instructions shortly before the agreed upon time which was a little tough since I did not have wireless access as a traveler, but I was ultimately able to call and sort it out by phone so I do appreciate her understanding. Gordon was the one who received me upon check-in (so I never actually met Prudence) and he was extremely hospitable. The room itself was clean and exactly as pictured. Do note the bathroom is upstairs and shared. The building is well-lit at night despite being in a bit of a remote area, and it is a short walk away from the station as described.

398147,8086827,15/10/2013,8153409,Christina Sejr,"Lara was a nice host and the flat was as expected and in a good location. This was our first stay with airbnb, so we were quite curious to see what it was like. You have to realize that the standard for apartments in London is on average lower than Scandinavia where we come from. As the heating was not turned on the first couple of days, we were quite cold, but this was a mistake which Lara corrected."

5011526,48426061,26/09/2015,42805353,Dalmo Magno,"Fiquei hospedado com minha filha por 10 dias nessa casa e a experiência foi muito agradável. O bairro é tranquilo, bonito e com fácil acesso ao centro de Londres por ônibus e metrô, o quarto é confortável e silencioso, e todos os membros da família são muito simpáticos, bem-humorados e fáceis de conviver. Tomamos café da manhã todos os dias e jantamos lá quase todas as noites, e, mais do que simples refeições, foram sempre momentos divertidos em que trocamos informações sobre nossas culturas e modos de vida. 
Eu não hesitaria em me hospedar lá novamente, e recomendaria a casa e a família a qualquer pessoa. 
O único fator que talvez possa incomodar a alguém de fora é que eles não consomem carne -mas para nós isso não foi nenhum problema."

She was lovely as always and welcomed me again warmly. I really enjoyed my second stay, it felt as if I never left and I really didn't want to leave! 
I recommend her place to everyone, long or short stay, the neighbourhood is lovely, the house is warm, comfortable and close to transport links. Dieneke does her best to make you feel at home and in my opinion she does a great job at that!
If I am ever in need of a place to stay in London again, I would totally go back to her. "

Even after such a short time Ich can say: Christine deserves being called a super host. I will definetely come back. I especially loved the mixture of privacy and having someone to chat with  in the morning.

Close to the metro, close to a bunch of amazing restaurants, and Portobello market! The flat was quiet with chirping birds in the trees near by and the bed was insanely comfortable. It was the perfect place to crash after a long day of exploring. Billy and Max even made arrangements that let us drop our bags off before check-in which was a lifesaver. I would love to come and stay again!"

The room was spacious and the bed comfortable, and the en suite bathroom was great. There was a nice breakfast spread every morning, and this was a great time to talk to Annie and Belinda and any other guests staying there. The location, while not central, was nice -- there are a couple streets full of nice restaurants and cafés just around the corner, and it was an easy commute to anywhere in the city.

The apartment is right at the heart of Shoreditch, a lively, busy and hip area. The apartment itself did not feel very clean (floor and carpets) and looks worn out. Additionally, the street side bedroom is extremely noisy, we had a hard time sleeping. The windows are thin and the shades are broken. Iron fell almost apart, unfit for use. Kitchenware was dirty and accessories in the kitchen (towels, etc) are limited."

One thing to remember is the card will expire exactly at 12 noon. I was lock outside accidentally and luckily the security person let me in again. Phew. Almost panic !

26838512,493976298,23/07/2019,86326058,Shuga,"To start with the tangibles: an awesome apartment with tons of space and great amenities. The building and flat were clean and in an easily accessible area. Don’t miss the rooftop patio, great views of the eye and provably a pretty rare space to enjoy downtown
Now, the intangibles: check in was probably the easiest I’ve ever experienced, with directions from the hosts on how to get to the flat easily. Dynamic check in was an amazing feature for my last minute booking, was a lifesaver when i needed to set my bags down quickly. The hosts took me on a tour of a house, set me up with keys and continued excellent hospitality the entire stay. Cats, especially Bean, were cute as can be. 

Overall, loved my stay, will definitely be looking for this option next time I’m back in town."

Everything was in order in the flat, the photos were accurate, the beds were comfortable and with crisp fresh linens, and the living room is quite roomy.  We had a wonderful stay, the tube station was a very easy few minutes walk, we could get everywhere for sightseeing easily on the District Line, and even easy to get to Paddington on the Hammersmith line.    Within walking distance of Spitalfields Market, very enjoyable market and great food trucks there too.   Tower Bridge is also within walking distance and enjoyed the riverside walks and restaurants of the South Bank.   Highly recommend Robin's place to stay."

Noise from the street could be heard in the front room as there is a pub across the street along with general passerbys, but the pub does close down around 11pm.  However, the bedroom in the back was very quiet, and once the pubs closed and the door between the kitchen and front room was shut, it was surprisingly peaceful.

Toby was very responsive and helpful and answered all my questions quickly and with attention.  The only issue is that picking up keys before 6pm can be a challenge depending on arrival times.  However, Toby was helpful in suggesting solutions. 

I would not hesitate to work with Toby again - especially if this flat is anything to go by."

The house is perfectly located close to major attractions and in an arms lentgh from local entertainment.

She was also really flexible with check-in and check-out times which I thought was particularly valuable in my case. The flat is just around the corner from the DLR and a pretty well stocked Co-op. The room itself was clean and quiet and appeared just as it does in the pictures. The bathroom is shared with another room, which is also rented, and it was clean as well.

It is spacious, really tidy and clean and the living room is a great spot to relax in with the open space and windows. Phaedra is an amazing host with great communication from the minute you book all the way up until the end of the trip. She is very friendly and accommodating and always available to answer any questions or help with anything that we may need. We stayed there with our 1 year old son and it was child friendly and comfortable. The location is great with easy quick access to supermarkets, local cafes and restaurants, and short walks to bus stops or train stations. It does take a bit of time to get into central London but it is an easy route to take.

There is a Santander bike station on the other side of the street and you can go almost to Camden Market along the canal. Despite the central location it is pretty quiet in the night.

583333,9069621,04/12/2013,9412477,Wai Kwen,"I had the great good fortune to pick the most wonderful B&B place in Gants Hill, if not London. Rafik and Evelin went out of their way to make me feel welcome and relaxed throughout my stay with them. The room is clean, spacious, beautifully decorated and furnished (like the rest of the house) and I had a huge bathroom and shower all to myself. There was a giant flat screen TV in the bedroom and the WIFI worked a treat. I could join the family for breakfast or make my own meals; the atmosphere was always relaxed and friendly. With 9 buses stopping right outside the house and an underground train station 3 bus stops away, i was able to get around very easily with an Oyster card. I would definitely stay here again!    "

Katie was really communicative and greeted me with a smile at the door. The location was quiet and easy to find, only a few mins stroll from the Tube. Would recommend to others coming for short trips. "

She was so helpful and knowledgable in the transit system! She even took the same bus on her way to work to make sure that I got on the correct path to the station to grab the tube to the airport. The room felt so fresh and clean! It was a true pleasure to stay with her in her lovely home!!! I am grateful!"
1117720,328534475,26/09/2018,130482247,Sophia,"Had a fantastic stay! This was my first time staying in London alone, and this spot was perfect. It is a twin bed so it really is for solo travelers only, but the space is comfortable! The view out of the window is lovely, the bed is comfortable, and the neighborhood is fantastic. It's super safe to walk around seemingly at any time of day. There's a grocery store within walking distance to pick up any British goods you want to bring home. Also there's enough wonderful brunch spots around you don't have to go to the same place any two days in a row! This apartment is a short walk from the tube, which made all my days so simple, and when I left for Paris, King's Cross is only one tube stop away (or, if you're traveling light, a short walk away!). Loic is very nice and had plenty of suggestions for travel plans, which I really appreciated. And the TV in the room is such a surprise added comfort. Instead of just watching videos on my phone, I got to watch some classic British television. So fun!"

2665295,59324004,09/01/2016,39649423,Chris,Vesna met me at the door when I arrived and gave me a quick tour of all the amenities.  The room was warm and cosy and the bed was comfortable and clean.  The house is a short walk to West Acton and a 20min walk to North Ealing.  The Japanese Delhi nearby is very good.  If you need a room in London then this is a very good option.

The room was big, the house is located in a rather quiet residential area, but easily walkable to elmstead woods station located 15 minutes away that takes you straight into central london. Both Vivien and Gena are such kind hosts and on a very personal note Vivien has made me feel so much better as I am going through some personal problems. She did way more than a host was suppose to and I am so grateful for her. She gave me a lot of tips on where to go too. If I come back to London I hope to come stay here again.  Again thank you so much for everything :) "

17819787,139968964,27/03/2017,48047296,Elena,"This place is located in a nice neighborhood near Angel Station with all the services you may need.Nice restaurants and groceries nearby. Unfortunately we found the appartment to be  different from the ad. In other words: the apartment was 'empty', as Eva explained, they moved to another place, and took almost everything with them, eventhough in the pics they had sidebed table lamps, we found non. The same with the kitchenware, they only left behind two plates, three plastic forks, and two coffee mugs -although in the ad it was announced that they had a fully equipped kitchen. The breakfast announced consisted in a few  earl grey tea bags  and some coffee powder, so it was not really breakfast... and we couldnt even serve it as there were no spoons. When we arrived the heat wasn't working, as the thermostat batteries were rotten inside, and it was quite cold, so we decided to finally contact the host and ask them to give us a solution, as there were so many inconsistencies and problems with the appartment.  After having some difficulties contacting her, as her phone died, the response was that the apartment gets hot enough during the day and that we really didnt need it, and that we should have enough with the cuttlery left. After such respone, and without giving us any solution as to how to fix the problems we decided to contact Airbnb.  We're so glad that Airbnb's customer service was there to help us with the communication and also trying to fix the inconveniences to make our stay much better. Airbnb refunded part of our stay, and made them come to the apartment and fix all the problems. They also offered to helps us find a new place in case they wouldnt have come to fix it.  Hopefully our stay will help them improve the appartment and mindset, as it really didnt feel like an Airbnb experience. On the other hand, we have to say that the apartment was very clean and well located.

32734129,483046456,07/07/2019,50762319,Sophie,"Gwilym’s place is ace! 

The space is super quirky and filled with character, full of Gwilyms favourite classic movies and super cool art. The kitchen is stocked up with tea, coffee, sugar, salt, spices - all the essentials you need to cook dinner if you want a night in.  Bed is comfy, shower is good, garden is adorable. Do not expect modern - but if you like quirky this place is perfect! 

Great location, right on Stoke Newington hight Street where there’s loads of cafes / restaurants / shops / bars. 2 minutes from easy overground links to everywhere in London. 

Check in was a dream - we were super late but he didn’t mind, and when we arrived he handed over the keys and said ‘let me know if you need anything, have a good night’ - so easy! Gwilym was respectful of our privacy but always only a text away, we needed a couple of things, and he sorted everything for us in minutes. All communication was really easy, polite and respectful. 

Gwilym also provided maps, and hand written recommendations for pubs, restaurants etc in the area, which was a really nice touch. And in addition, the neighbours were having a little street party whilst we were there, and were all really friendly and made the space feel super homely and safe!

10/10 would 100% recommend this place!"

13594720,84600560,08/07/2016,80311555,Matthew,"Staying at George's apartment was really an amazing experience, period! I arrived an hour later than planned and Gavin (George's boyfriend) was patiently awaiting my arrival and greeted me with a genuine smile and a warm welcome. George arrived later that evening and emulated the same friendliness and graciousness while ensuring that I was taken care of, both in the room, and with my overall London plans as well. George and Gavin were always at the ready to provide support and were very responsive to every question and need over the course of my stay. 

The apartment is is exactly as described in her advertisement, and the pictures are reflective of what her home looks like: its extremely clean tidy, and most of all, comfortable. Between the ambiance, aesthetic and the hosts' personalities, it really felt like home. George was very generous with the facilities in her home, and even more so, with her recommendations and knowledge of both Camden and the greater London area. I spent hours speaking with both her and Gavin about the city (as it was my first time visiting) and they completely indulged my chatterboxness with friendly conversation. 

Beyond the apartment, the Camden area is also a VERY cool and a fun place to be. I was not planning on visiting Camden during my stay, but luckily I came across George's listing and decided to stay there. She is in an AMAZING location in very close proximity to Camden Town Underground station on the Northern Line, which provides extremely easy access to all parts of Zone 1. I also spent a good amount of (unplanned) time around the Camden area because I was so pleasantly surprised by all the unique cafes, restaurants and bars that line the streets in the area. 

I would HIGHLY recommend staying with George if her unit is available and plan to do so myself whenever I am back in London!! "

There are no welcoming drinks or snacks and its uncomfortable knowing what to use or not.  The company that helps rent the flat is totally unhelpful.  They don't send emails that are promised, they have difficulty because their first language is not English, (and I'm sympathetic to that because I teach ESL classes,) and they repeatedly ask for information already provided.  I'd look for another place."

Very charismatic, enjoys talking to people, and he can also give you a lot of tips on where to go or what to do. The place is great as well, conveniently located close to bus stops, overground and lots of pubs and restaurants. You've got all you need, comfy bed, mid size room, a desk, wardrobe, and of course you can access the common areas like the bathroom/shower and kitchen. Good value for money, for sure. I'd stay there again when I go to London."

It is a quiet neighborhood - good after a busy day. Public transport in London is great, so it is easy to get to the sights from here.
Thanks for having us, Gene."

13052306,128872721,28/01/2017,32278834,Tanya,"I didn't have big expectations on this place as I was prepared to get what I paid for but it actually surprised me! Fantastic and fast communication with Gareth, accommodating me with self check-in as I had a late night flight into London, the cleaner was in every morning which was great and I was lucky enough to only have one guest in the room I was staying in. 

I should also probably mention that when you book a 'female only' dorm, you should be prepared that it is a female only ROOM. 
I was very happy with that as it was very quiet and clean. 
Compared to the mixed room...(Boys need to learn to clean after themselves and have manners!) 

I had a very pleasant stay and I will be back. 

Thanks! 

Best,

The cellular toilets are always smelly, though, and there are by far not enough sanitary facilities for such a lot of people. In the area, cheap food is not that easy to find, Borough Market is rather exclusive. In my view, the staff was a bit pretentious and not too cordially..."

44474429,656013554,24/08/2020,47525405,Georgina,"Unfortunately our experience at the Collective wasn’t a good one. 

They changed the listing after we booked, it originally clearly stated ‘Free Parking’ and breakfast being as included but this was not the case. When we went to pre book the car in we were told it was £36 for 3 nights so in fact it was not free ( we even had a screenshot of it stating free parking ) and when we got there the car was not even booked in.

Due to the pandemic the buffet breakfast was closed so the receptionist told us we would get a breakfast bag and a drink, the following morning we got a banana and yogurt , no hot drink we had to contact reception about these and got them an hour later! We then received nothing the following 2 days and were told it was not included when it had clearly stated it was when we booked. So it cost us more to go out for breakfast and to pay for parking. We have noted that the description on Airbnb has since changed.

My sunglasses I 100% left in the room have also gone missing.

On a positive note the room was clean and just what we needed as a base just a shame we experienced all the other issues."

Ihan pienen kävelymatkan päässä on kauppa, pizzeria sekä fish and chips mesta. Hieman pidemmän kävelymatkan päässä on jo sitten enemmän kaikenlaisia kauppoja ja ravintoloita.

21208207,557507051,01/11/2019,189790750,Carina,"I stayed at Tilda’s just for a few days, but it felt like home right away.

The very best about being here, were the chats, we had now and then, that really made me feel like I was part of the family. I travelled alone and I was so happy, that there was someone, who wishes me a nice day whenever I left the room and asked me about my day, every evening when I came back. She even asked me, if I had dinner, or if I would like to have a portion of her homemade meals (which were very delicious by the way) :-), she cooked for herself and her lovely son.
Tilda really cares about her guests and offers everything you need for a pleasant stay. Not just material things like hairdryer, dishes etc., she always has got a warm smile and an open ear for you.

The room is simple, but it has got everything you need. For example: cozy beds with warm blankets, a table with chairs or different adapters to charge your technical devices.

The accommodation is just a stones throw away from the station with excellent links to central London or Liverpool Street (perfect for travellers from Stansted Airport). The bus stop is even nearer and you won’t have problems to get home at any day- or nighttime.

The area is quiet and safe and I was never afraid to walk home alone from the station, even at night.
Grocery stores are located nearby and you can get everything for your meals within a 5 minutes walking distance.

For all those amenities, the price is unbeatable.

I really recommend Tilda’s place, especially for people, who are travelling alone.
I would definitely spend my next holidays in this nice and homely atmosphere again."

La salle de bains privée est un grand avantage, surtout pour une famille. Tout est équipé, propre, et de petites provisions sont prévues également. Nous n'avons pas rencontré l'hôte, mais l'organisation est parfaite et un classeur est à disposition avec les recommandations et toutes les petites adresses pratiques du quartier. A mentionner: l'excellente petite terrasse privée du studio!! Un charme en plus et le top pour prendre le petit déjeuner dehors. Je recommande vivement!!!

16674189,165321599,30/06/2017,44743354,Cameron,We stayed here due to its proximity to Wembley. At short notice and at a fantastic rate I don't think you can find much better. We found getting a taxi to Wembley to be too difficult due to traffic so I would recommend getting the Bakerloo line. Jackson and his partner were very welcoming and friendly. Both the bathroom and bedroom we used were comfortable and clean.

Their cozy house is located just two minutes from the bus stop, bus takes you to the underground station in about half an hour and then you can get to the city centre in 15 minutes. The house is just next to the lake and the supermarket is nearby. You have your own bathroom there and can also use the kitchen and other things you may need.

It's 1 minute walk from West Kensington tube station and Barclays Cycle station. Tesco Express is really close.
Everyday we used cycles to get the center of London (Oxford street, Westminster etc.) - it's very easy, fast and cheap.
Perfect for three persons - 2+1.
Railroad is very quiet. And no one could hear trains during all night.
Friendly and lovely people.

Всем рекомендую! Хорошее расположение, невысокая цена относительно аналогичных предложений, очень приветливые хозяева. Транспортная доступность на уровне. Запросто до центра можно добираться на велосипедах (станция расположена в 100 метрах от двери).
Кому лень крутить педали - до метро минуту пешком.

She was quick to respond to my texts, eager to help in any way she could, and when my daughter left her dragon cloak under the bed, Janan was happy to meet us in central London to return it.  

The location is a bit away from central London, but if you plan on leaving for the day instead of going back and forth, the price and the lovely hostess make it totally worth it."

Do I have regrets? No, I don't. It was more than I expected, If i'm guaranteed to get another host like Pepe, i'd do it again and again.

Pepe was a perfect host. From the communication when trying to book, to the check in process up to check out, it was great.

He's gone ahead to provide the basic things that we tend to forget when traveling e.g. Phone charger (Android & IPhone), toothpaste, etc. Over and above that, he provides candy (for the sweet tooth) and a weighing scale for heavy travelers like me :-) . It was just like home, indeed it's a home!

The house is clean and in a quiet place. It's near the Lambeth North station (1 min walk)

As a person, Pepe has many rules, he's strict, but friendly (I saw myself in him). If you stick by the rules, you are safe.

I'd recommend his place if you love cleanliness and a stickler for rules."

The carpeting looked like it hadn’t been cleaned or vacuumed prior to our visit and the bed linens were very warn out. In the common areas we were disappointed in the ability to utilize the kitchen for cooking.

Lastly, we noticed orangish mold in the shower curtain. Our first morning did not have hot water in the shower or sink which was frustrating considering the temperature outside.

It would have been nice to know ahead of time that the host decided to have a dinner party. While we didn’t mind and were (Website hidden by Airbnb) was uncomfortable, worrisome, and not professional considering our belongings were not behind a locked door.

Overall, we loved London!"
33093786,483193476,07/07/2019,211370579,Simon,Over priced. The rooms were very warm and the air conditioning units provided blew out hot air which counteracted the cold air coming out. The air conditioning units should have a vent pipe on the back venting them to the atmosphere. This made for a very uncomfortable hot and sticky night. The table in the hall way is a fire hazard which restricts the access to the rooms. The microwave is not necessary and the fridge stuck out to far. We couldn’t control the velux window blinds independently and one control did them both. These need to be controlled individually and an option to open the velux window to let some fresh air in would have been nice. Great location but needs some improvements to be able to justify £150 per room per night.

The neighbourhood is very peaceful and quiet. I highly recommend this place. Be aware of travel time to Central London, which may take an hour on the Tube, but I didn't minded since I am trying out the suburban area of London."

Howevere, because of my limited time I had tk be out almost all the 5 days. All in all I can say that their house is in a really nive spot and the view of the room is quit great, the only down side is that It's not suitable for someone's who spend all his day out and coming home late at night due to low availability of publice transportation after 23:30 (Only Uber would get u there fast)."

Construction next door started a bit earlier in the morning than posted, and the building is showing its age.  The lift is convenient, but if you have mobility issues, be aware that the tub/shower is very high to enter.  Good dining options around the corner.  Value option for an expensive town."

(Terry has a very good interior taste :-) He also is a very good host, very open minded and interested. I really enjoyed talking with him and loved his ideas what to do and to explore.
I would totally recommend staying at his house, which is by the way in a very nice area, directly in Herne Hill, a lovely area to stay with good traffic connections.
I hope to see Terry again."

We loved being about to walk around town (especially down the canals!) rather than having to always catch the train/bus. When we did catch public transport, the stations were a super quick walk from the apartment which was great. The apartment was lovely - a beautiful relaxing space. We loved looking over the little park at the back of the property.  

Sue was a great host, couldn’t have wished for better. Thanks again :)"

Longer version: the room is exactly as displayed in the pictures and is actually bigger than it appears. Also has a few intimate touches which is appreciated for a stay with a partner. One thing that isn't mentioned is that the room has Chromecast installed which boosted the experience for me. 
I was checked in by Suzana who was very friendly and efficient with the process with good response times for requests.
location is 10minutes from a station with easy transportation links to Stratford westfield or local shops. All in all, money well spent "

Rupert is such a superb host and extremely helpful. He help us arrange the taxi from Heathrow airport, welcome us upon our arrival help us with our luggages, show us through his place and also stock up some grocery in the fridge for our family. Moreover, he also prepared us a map of restaurants and shops around the area, transportation guide and useful information which we found very useful. The house was clean, well organised, very comfortable, stylishly decorates with a great selection of books, music, decoration pieces. Located at a good location for both bus and tube station, the neighbourhood is a great place to stay extremely convenience with the supermarket just around the corner.

Staying at Rupert’s place is our family most favourite Airbnb experiences by far. We had a very nice 10 days stay and we would definitely stay there again the next time we visit London."

This house was perfectly located, we could walk there leaving the car parked outside the house. The shops cafes and restaurants were just a stroll away;  so very convenient. Above all we were feeling pretty emotional and tattered, requiring a warm friendly home that we could just relax in between visits. All our needs were met and we can’t thank our hosts enough."

The location was fantastic, as we were less than a quarter mile from an amazing mall, great places to eat, and a central tube station.
The condo itself was incredibly clean, and the patio area had a nice view. This was my first time in London, so I dont have other areas to compare to, but I can say the neighborhood was very quiet, especially at night. This was definitely appreciated as we needed the rest for work. If you are looking for nightlife, it is definitely close enough to walk or you can take the tube just about anywhere.
The host kept in contact before and during the trip to ensure everything went smooth, and gave accurate instructions for the check in process.
I would definitely consider staying here again if I went back to London."

She was extremely accommodating due to the fact that she cooked for me several times, she supplied me with filtered water, coffee, tea and my own set of dishes. She has a very bubbly personality so i felt right at home and she's just great to be honest. She is the type of person you just want to be friends with. Steph was so sweet as well and he gave me a ride to the train station on my way back to the airport! I just couldn't believe my luck with this airbnb experience. I was stranded after i missed my flight and Agatha let me stay an extra day. I have no complaints. The dog (Santos) was also very quiet and seemed harmless and he mostly kept to himself. I'll be staying here again. Thank you so much Agatha and Steph :)"

Dann haben wir Elisa und Dom kennengelernt. Ich fasse mich kurz, ich habe selten eine solche uneingeschränkte Gastfreundschaft erlebt. Die beiden sind so nett und unkompliziert, wir hatten schon nach 10 Minuten das Gefühl zur Familie zu gehören. Das Zimmer ist super, blitzsauber, das separate Badezimmer stand nur uns zur Verfügung und war ebenfalls in einem top Zustand. Das Bett war super bequem, Bettwäsche und Handtücher vorhanden und auch alles duftend und blitzsauber. Die Lage ist perfekt, die Anbindung zu den öffentlichen Verkehrsmitteln ist phantastisch, Bus  in ca. 80 Metern, die nächste U-Bahn in ca. 300 Metern bzw. in ca. 400 Metern. Das größte Indoor Westfield Shopping Center Europas ist fußläufig erreichbar. Nach einigen Metern ist man auch bei diversen Burger, Shops und Restaurants, hier muss keiner Hunger leiden. Trotz der zentralen Lage ist es in der Seitenstraße so ruhig das man das Gefühl hat auf dem Dorf zu wohnen. Das morgendliche kleine Frühstück ist inklusive und super, man hat was im Bauch wenn man in die Stadt aufbricht. In Summe eine absolute Empfehlung für eine Reise nach London mit 2 Personen, ich würde und werde sofort wieder buchen, beim nächsten London Trip! Alle Daumen hoch, sehr sehr zu empfehlen! Vielen Dank Dom und Elisa!"

The house is on a quiet street away from the noise, but close enough to visit bars and restaurants.  There was free parking on the street throughout our stay.  There were ants in the living room, it could have been better equipped (e.g. toilet paper and bathroom soaps) and the sofa bed was extremely uncomfortable.  I wouldn't advise against it, but I would hesitate to stay here again for a group that needs 4 beds."

Very quiet area with no problems at all, easy walk to either Haydon’s Road or Colliers Wood tube. 

Garden shed pub ok, Charles Holden opposite Colliers tube a lot better. 

Wimbledon is walking distance and the park land in both directions is very nice and friendly. 

If I needed to work from that area again I’d definitely ask John first."

7243380,346348233,08/11/2018,8436891,Joanna,"Oliver and Sonja's flat is wonderful and they were great hosts! Oliver was prompt and helpful throughout our stay and even went out of his way to stock our fridge with late night snacks as we were arriving after all the restaurants had closed. The pictures are accurate, with lots of amenities, comfortable bedding, and a lovely deep soaking tub. The house is located 8-9 minutes from two tube stops in either direction of the house, and both routes have groceries, restaurants, and coffee shops along the way. We really appreciated the time they took to explain the area to us and their list of recommended attractions/restaurants, etc. was immensely helpful and gave us a great starting point to explore the neighborhood. There were thoughtful touches throughout the house, like extra adapters, coffee/tea options,  lots of closet space, and having the washing machine meant that we actually could have packed even less. Overall, a wonderful place, lovely hosts and we'd most definitely stay there again!"

4338431,27513244,06/03/2015,22665055,Bee,"We spent a few nights in this lovely Farringdon apartment last week.  Location wise, it is in the heart of a very vibrant area with excellent links to a number of transport options.  It is also within walking distance to many of London's wonderful areas, St Pauls, Holborn, Islington.  There are a fantastic selection of eateries very close by and a number of lovely old school pubs.  
The apartment is in a warehouse conversion and is bright and spacious, it has a well equipped kitchen with lots of basic groceries.
It should be be noted that there is a building site directly opposite, which is active from the morning until around 5pm but not on weekends.  As you are out most of the day we did generally not find it a problem.
Leora was an excellent host, we had a card and chocolates waiting on the table for our arrival.  She was very thorough with showing us around and going through how everything worked and was very responsive when I emailed her with any queries regarding our stay.  We had a minor issue arise while we were there and she handled it smoothly and we were very satisfied with the outcome.
I would stay again."
38097862,576339047,13/12/2019,761398,Roger,Spotlessly clean room and shared bathroom a stone's throw from Camden tube station at a very reasonable price. What's not to like?

We stayed for 2 nights during the weekend and enjoyed ourselves very much. We arrived an hour late due to flight delay but this was no issue for Margaret. She is very easy to communicate with and responded almost directly on all our requests. 

If you need a place to stay in London for 2 there's really no need to look any further!"

24302262,270420735,29/05/2018,65476310,Erkan,"Not that there were particular problems with the flat but the pictures were much nicer than the reality. 

It had less comfort (no coffee, proper dining area, proper sofa for a 3-bedroom flat, TV, magazines, full shampoo/soap) than the other cheaper Airbnb flats I stayed. Maybe it is particular to London.

I would not recommend to a family, but for young bunch of friends looking a place to crash it would be OK."

This is a great location; it's close to everything in Shoreditch and just a couple of blocks from the train. Their home is comfortable, safe, and clean — I recommend staying here.

Staying at Roger's charming and historical place was/is a treat and I immediately felt at home (I wish it was!). It really is a gem and situated in a very nice and save area and close to, well... everything. My room was cozy and had been fitted with every conceivable comfort, including an excellent bed. Also very clean, as was the whole apartment. 
But the best part of it all: it comes with a truly lovely host! Roger is very kind and considerate and does everything to make you feel welcome and comfortable (loved the nuts :)). He checked in once in a while, which I really appreciated, and is always available in case you need anything. Think my stay couldn’t have been any better. Is ‘Perfectness’ – with a capital P – a word? ;) Surely hope to return next time I’m in London."

=====
Vivian & Alex offer a great accommodation in a really nice neighborhood of London. You can’t go wrong with the Camden :). Read on if, you care for more details.

Location
========
The room is located in the Camden district, just north of the city center. Supermarkets (Tesco Express, LIDL, etc.) are right around the corner or a short walk away from the apartment. If you care for dinner in the evening, we can highly recommend Franco Manca ( (Website hidden by Airbnb) in case you enjoy delicious pizza.

Transportation
==============
There’s a bus stop right around the corner with buses leaving every 5 to 8 Minutes. Route 29 takes you to Trafalgar Square in around 20 Minutes. You can also take the bus to „Camden Road“ or „Camden Town“ to continue your travels over- or underground. Having overground, underground and the bus at your disposal eases getting from and to your location, since the tube does not run 24/7 (which was news to us).

Check-In
========
The Check-In was very simple. Vivian provided us with a detailed description of how and when to get into the apartment.

Accommodation
=============
The room is located on the top floor of the building with the windows facing a calm and quiet back road, so there isn’t any noise bothering you once you get home after a long day out and about. In the hallway you find a toaster oven, fridge, cutlery, a water cooker and treats like cereal and very tasty cookies. 

The room itself offers a large bed which easily fits two people with room to spare. There is a built in closet for storage as well as a small table with chairs - ideal for morning breakfasts, before you get going. 

The bathroom is very clean and all yours. It offers a large mirror, large shower and amenities like shampoo and shower gel.

We noticed a minor problem with the flush one morning, informed Vivian who had her husband fix it, while we were gone. Just great!

Summary
=======
We used airbnb for the first time going to London. We couldn’t have hoped for a nicer host."
971818,297763876,28/07/2018,24133613,Adele," Marius has made this place wonderful. Immaculate, and absolutely everything provided. I am hoping to stay here again! And it’s in such a good location with London Bridge station and underground 2 mins away and the same with Tescos and Marks and Spencer’s Simply Food. I loved this place and Marius was a wonderful host -even a gorgeous bunch of flowers was on the table! Thank you."
792588,12367844,30/04/2014,12316219,Valentina,"The room is tidy and clean as well as the whole apartment. Hoxton overground station is just round the corner. The area is just lovely, very close to the most fashonable places in London. Coulmbia flower market closeby and Broadway market within a short walk. Boxpark is just few minutes walking as well as Brick lane and Spitafield.
Mike is just the best host you can have, he will give you all the tips about the surroundings and is fully available should you need anything.
I warmly reccomend this flat for a visit in London and will surely come back."

38965461,595468966,20/01/2020,246826470,Steven,Awesome location overlooking Piccadilly Circus.  Place is modern and has all the items one would need.  Fully stocked kitchen which was good for us because we cooked breakfast every day.  The double pane windows keep the noise out from outside but you can open the windows and hear the sounds of downtown London if you wish.
14914050,139403861,25/03/2017,113079852,Deborah,Excellent location and helpful hosts. Rather tiny space - not for the claustrophobic...but perfectly adequate for short stay.
13402847,143943456,14/04/2017,73004200,Irene,We really enjoyed our stay at Annies place. It was an easy check-in and -out. The house looks exactly like in the pictures and we can recommend it to anyone who wants to stay in a calm part of London. 
19468080,363290566,28/12/2018,6808177,Theo,"Spacious, clean and thoughtful are the words i would use to best describe my stay on Christmas Eve and Christmas day. You will not find a better  home or a more lovely Airbnb host in New Malden. Sally was amazingly kind and her home is perfect place to stay. New Malden High street is 5 minutes away with over a dozen Korean Restaurants and train to central London nearby."
21557916,564267112,15/11/2019,261717308,Maria,"Clive has been a wonderful host. He helped us and showed us the area. The apartment was clean and cozy and is a perfect place to start you individual London trip. 20 Minutes to London Bridge (with the overground trains), perfect!

Clive assisted a lot and was extremely friendly. Nice to talk to him about everything. We enjoyed our stay very much and will come back someday, for sure!"

2839143,580771704,23/12/2019,133325679,Joe,Davey’s place was immaculately clean and very warm and inviting. Davey’s hospitality was exceptional and provided a welcome pack with lots of goodies that was very much appreciated. Location is great as it is virtually a stones throw from Greenwich station which makes it easy for to get out and about. It is a short walk to all the shops and amenities in Greenwich which is also handy. Can’t recommend this place highly enough for anyone visiting London.
5657519,50582762,12/10/2015,45885715,Rose,"Dabbys London accommodation was perfect for a weekend away! Located so conveniently next to vauxhall tube centre with all the cities best attractions close by. The room itself was beautiful, comfortable bed, lots of space, great outdoor terrace and we were provided with fresh towels and bathrobes.

7085928,41505702,07/08/2015,37859336,Kimberly,"Rhian and her home were an absolute delight. I'm so thankful I found this listing.

Rhian is an accommodating host who makes you feel welcome in her home but also gives you your privacy and space. Her sparkling personality is comforting and helps you feel at home, whether it be a short stay or a long one. Rhian's dog is also a sweet addition that helped me deal with my own home-sickness for my dogs.

The room is more than enough space for a solo traveller and has ample cupboard storage. I loved the little window overlooking the rear of the property which provided lovely natural light during the day. The in-room tea making facilities were also a treat so I didn't have to go downstairs when I wanted a midnight cuppa. 
The bathroom is just across the hall and is shared with the two other house guests whose bedrooms are on the top floor of the mews. It's beautifully renovated and I even got a space in the vanity to store all my toiletries.

The lounge room and kitchen were well maintained and always clean. I always had enough room to do my own thing without feeling like I was invading someone else's space, and visa versa. 

I will definitely be looking to stay at Rhian's again when I'm next in London.

13512606,660561964,05/09/2020,13990270,Maxine,A lovely quiet and peaceful home.  Alice is a wonderful host and made sure that I had a relaxing break.  Highly recommended.
7847545,439131973,18/04/2019,28893062,Adeline,"Sarah's place is simply wonderful. Accurate to the pictures but even more charming in person. I especially loved the living space. My husband and I stayed for close to a month and since it was more of a work trip than a holiday Sarah's home was a home away from home. Fully equipped for cooking in terms of utensils, pots and pans and a great supply of herbs and spices. The place is extremely clean and Sarah is extremely attentive to providing clean linen and towels weekly. The bedroom is spacious and has loads of wardrobe space. The apartment itself is on the third floor without a lift which really isn't too difficult except if you have tons of luggage, like us. In terms of location, Sarah's home is about a 12-15min walk to Walthomstow Central Station which can get you into all the key areas in central London within 20 minutes. Loads of international food stores around and Tescos, Asda and Lidl and the Walthomstow market within 10-15 minutes on foot. Walthomstow itself is lovely and a lot quieter than other parts of London and is extremely charming and holds a lot of it's own history."
22190897,253422402,14/04/2018,50299034,Clare,"Although the property was very clean and modern, it was not ideal for commuting into central London. Around a 30 minute walk to Stratford station and West Ham ( having to walk through very precarious estates with 2 young children!!) 
Not a great self catering kitchen as only 1 pan was provided and very limited equipment. Be sure to take all your own essentials like dishwasher tablets as these are not available either."

Nous avons aimé séjourner dans cet appartement typiquement anglais le temps de notre séjour londonnien. L'appartement est conforme aux photos et à la description, cosy et propre. De plus, bien que nous soyons débutants, nous avons pris plaisir à jouer quelques notes de piano. 
En ce qui concerne les transports en commun, bien que l'appartement ne soit pas situé dans l'hypercentre de Londres, il est plutôt bien desservi : le métro et les bus sont à environ 10-15 minutes.
Pour résumer, nous recommandons !"

The whole flat was very clean and we felt very welcomed. Malachy was super friendly and gave us lots of good recommendations as where to go for breakfast, drinks etc. Hackney is a very cool area in London, worth exploring if you're looking for something a bit different.

The balcony overlooks a quiet internal residential area and the two lakes nearby - amazing view, but at the same minutes from the station which made it very easy for us to do sight seeing. 
Claudia was very friendly and explained everything we needed to know in advance, also very flexible to accommodate a late check-in and a later check-out. My parents and I felt absolutely comfortable as if we were at home and I will definitely book this again for them and/or other visitors. "

Her house is spotlessly clean, warm and comfy. The room is better than the pictures. The bed is very soft and comfortable. There is enough space in the room - chest of drawers, cupboard, shelves, etc to keep your things. A lovely bookcase has some amazing books - including my favorite 'Breakfast At Tiffany's'.

Pam provided a huge choice of delicious food for breakfast. She also meticulously laid the breakfast table for us, every day, even when she was leaving early for work. 

Pam is an excellent cook and we were treated to the full English breakfast as well as a scrumptious Thai green curry dinner.

Not to forget, we enjoyed our conversations and musical sessions.

We have a new friend in London!"

This is in a lovely location next to a little park, and not too far from underground public transport. Plus the Victoria line is the best line to be situated near, the fastest one in London!! The benefit of Seven Sisters is also it's proximity to the East, as well as being able to bounce into central London quickly. Thoroughly recommend!"

As others mentioned, it is quite small, but overall I found it a good fit for my needs. Check in and communication were great. My only real criticism is that the actual location of the apartment is several blocks south-west from the stated position. Had I known this I might have opted for something a little closer to the conference I was attending. Not abut  huge deal, but something others should know. "

I didn't see much of Angela as she was away when I arrived, but checking in was super easy and well organised and her daughter Steph made me feel welcome and showed me the ropes.
Big, spacious room with a good comfy bed and much needed complimentary tea and biscuits after a long journey down from Yorkshire :)
Two friendly cats that live in the kitchen welcomed me home every evening too!!

1891362,202876548,13/10/2017,63120118,Chan,"Mark's flat is clean and well stocked. The fridge was stocked with water, juice and milk..and beer. This was a pleasant surprise!  It's in a great location close to a lot shops and restaurants - Sloane Square and Kings Road and is less than 10 minutes to the tube probably closer to 5 minutes.  The flat is on the lower floor with a narrow short staircase (typical of these types of homes though) that was a bit tough with big luggage and it also didn't get a lot of natural light. The washer and dryer is not in the flat but just outside of it. Other than those minor things, my family enjoyed staying there. Mark was very responsive throughout the process. We didn't run into any problems during the stay."

22584269,306804459,13/08/2018,189368124,Em,Thanks for making my first airbnb experience run smoothly especially with the anxiety I had a few days before.

1220145,485613124,11/07/2019,214027574,Michael,"Robert's home reflects him - comfortable, classic, homey, character and class. This was my first trip to London and part of the enjoyable and perfect experience was in part thanks to Robert and his charming apartment. From the easy access, privacy, advice and recommendations, to the decor, accessories and location, Robert's place is absolutely the best in the city by far! Robert went above and beyond to get to know me but also make sure I had what I needed to orient myself to a brand new city: maps, guide books and plenty of places to dine and shop just in the neighborhood. It didn't hurt that there is a stable not 100 feet from the flat. Seeing the horses every morning was a treat! And the entire neighborhood was peaceful and quiet. This is a family neighborhood so if you're looking to party outdoors until 3 am, you'd be better off someplace else. But why would you do that, when you can enjoy the city at all hours and come back to the comfort and peace of Robert's place. And having a stocked fridge and next-day laundry service provided by Robert didn't hurt either. Think about it - not having to pack an extra suitcase! And for those visiting in the summer, the flat stayed pretty cool - even when the daytime temps reached 80. The cross-ventilation and fan kept me quite cool at night. The perfect place, in the perfect location, Robert's home will make you want to stay forever. Thank you, Robert, for making my first trip to London certainly not my last."
18436650,303469868,07/08/2018,160883,Shelley,"Nicely appointed room, I would recommend a fan during hot weather as one window opened with little ventilation.

It's a basic, no-frills room for crashing at night while you explore London in the day, at a decent price for the city. The rest of the apartment's occupants kept to themselves while I was there, and everyone was generally quite mindful of each other's privacy."

Fabulous attractions such as Royal Albert Hall and Kensington  Palace were all within walking distance or for the those less inclined to walk public transport was easy and just around the corner. There is no shortage of restaurants to choose from within a short  distance, and I can vouch for Bombay Brasserie being delicious. If what you want to experience during your stay in London is a home that has character and very loved (taking in their artwork and curios had us guessing about their experiences) then look no further. They were wonderful hosts who attended to our queries promptly as well as ensuring during our stay that all was well. Thank you and given the opportunity we would stay again."

The flat : exceptionally cozy and well organised. No noise. Charming terrace with table and flowers. Large comfy bedroom. Two-windowed living room with books, art on the walls... You really feel at home, and not in one of those anonymous ikea-clone rental flats.
We have rented tens of flats all over the world. This one is among the 3 best.
Last but not least, a charming and very well educated owner. "

Centrally located, fun and lively neighborhood, and a delightful host--I loved the feeling of it all as it was as relaxing as being home. Charlotte could not have been more attentive to me.

Good communication with Fari even if we did not meet each other
The studio is a little bit small with a toddler, but if you spend your day visiting and come back only to sleep it will be enough. 
The price is reasonable according the short distance to London center"
26728999,336518483,14/10/2018,66213101,Edouard,"Niralee and Dustin were very welcoming. The instructions to get to their place were really detailed and helpful. The room is comfy and the bathroom is also great. 

Transportation wise : It was really easy to get everywhere by bus and there is the overground just next to the building. We also walked easily from liverpool street station with our luggages at our arrival in 20 min. 
Shoreditch is also a really nice neighborhood (we went to the flower market on Sunday in 5 min by foot) and the bars and restaurant are plentiful (Dishoom is great, just get beers for the line to complete the chai tea that they give you in order to wait)."
35036041,586866003,02/01/2020,137701335,Glynis,"Brilliant, clean, lots of extras for us, comfy and nice and private. Would definitely return."

Daniela is such a nice person, and she responds quickly which make you feel relaxed to deal with her.
I recommend staying in Daniel’s place, you will feel home within her place. Though it is a bit far but the public transportation is 2 mins walking, so I see no problems for tourists."

599058,7359151,17/09/2013,4246501,Ric,Tim was a fantastic host. His flat is well positioned and provided everything we needed for a great stay in London. Tim's prompt communication made it easy for us to make the most of our visit. We would certainly have no hesitation in recommending his flat for anyone wanting to experience life as a'Londoner'.
9787800,115403918,24/11/2016,4452296,Frank,Ajit is a great host. Got all we asked for and more. Would recommend this place to couples and singels. Acton Town is a pretty decent place to stay in. Local feel to it. Friendly people around and no crime etc. Will return.
35377660,588347109,04/01/2020,288678786,Christos,"The experience started bad from the get  go with the rates advertised being changed midstream without warning.
We had requested a deep clean to accomodate a severe allergic child, yet no consideration was afforded for this allergy and we found ourselves spending the entire first day cleaning the apartment ourselves. 
Strict instructions were given to make no noise, yet all the remaining tenants in the building made noise at all hours of the night disrupting our sleep.
Rattling pipes deprived us of sleep for 5 consecutivenights with no resolution despite consistent notifications to the landlord.
Overall, this was a horrible experience."
32430300,583128351,28/12/2019,75389530,Mee-C,"I could not love this place enough.. its probably the best place that my family and I have stayed in so far. The listing doesnt do justice to the actual place. Praveen stocked up on more than the essentials in the home, and was so thoughtful to include a baby tub for us for my baby. Our stay in London was more memorable because his place really felt a home away from home."
19716534,282479608,27/06/2018,11518815,Paul,Jools was a great host and has a lovely home in a great location.   Only ten mins walk to Earlsfield station.   Lots of lovely restaurants and pubs around.   Nice room and a good stay.

38604498,614771719,06/03/2020,205477232,Christopher,"Large, bright unit in an Incredible location.  Everything is as pictured, with large open area and separated bedrooms offering privacy.  A few amenities need to be replaced, but nothing was completely unusable.   Our only “big” complaint was the mattress in the center bedroom was terribly uncomfortable.  Other than that, we would definitely stay again.  Communication with the hosts was great once we arrived, and check in was perfect."

Nice location, just a couple of minutes from the Holborn Station, so even if you go back a bit late, you won’t feel insecure to go along the way! The room is spacious enough and the bedding is clean. What’s more, both Adele and Federico are very kind-hearted, supportive and quick in response! Therefore, I strongly recommend this room to you all!"

97178,15856020,17/07/2014,9795346,Michael,Very friendly family and easy to get along with and helpful with suggestions etc. Especially a medical centre which was needed and very close by. Quiet neighbourhood. Shops etc within 2 minute walk plus a HUGE Westfield shopping centre around 20 minutes walk away. Room did have balcony and even though a train line is quite close to house it was not too annoying. Sally and Savvas live a very casual easy going lifestyle so if you can accept that all will be good.Enjoyed my stay.

We however found the street noise difficult to cope with, and invested in ear plugs which helped!  The alley approaching the outer entrance is at first a bit daunting but we soon got used to that.  the bed was comfy but the pull out sofa bed less so!  Nora was very communicative and helpful and overall we enjoyed our stay there.  thank you."

The location is ideal for anyone who wants to stay close to Central London but away from its hecticness - also extremely close to  the Broadway Market, Rebecca's (Hidden by Airbnb) are lovely people who made me feel right at home, you have everything you might need within walking distance and the room is tremendous! Very recommended."
6316365,481276593,04/07/2019,94379932,Fabricio,"Yvonne is a really great host, she is very friendly, we felt very comfortable at her place. The house is well connected with the city centre and the room is big with a bathroom inside. She made us breakfast every morning (it was delicious and abundant (more than we  (people used to argetinian breakfast) could eat)) .  The cats are friendly too. We are very thankful of her and obviously we'll stay there again."

14114608,218208413,11/12/2017,148970235,Rob,A very stylish home in a great location in Vauxhall. The house was very clean and well presented. The only negative for us was that during our stay the underfloor heating didnt appear to be working on the ground floor.  A plug in radiator was provided but as it was a cold weekend the ground floor never really warmed up. Otherwise would recommend.

594831,331723865,03/10/2018,217410545,Santeri,"There came only cold water no any hot or even warm water. Its weird that in that high level place you cant go to warm shower. 6 days without possibility to go warm shower in you apartment is pretty rough. I tried to contact the owner via airbnb but he didnt answer and when i called to him he was just kind of laughing to the cold water problem. Other than that, the place was really nice and close to underground station."

Dave and Karen are what airbnb is all about - hosts who really care about their guests and their comfort, who are interested in them and really want to help make your stay as good as it can be. We are so glad we stayed, but even happier to have meet our lovely hosts. Wonderful.

So close to London with great transport links close by. The local area is quiet, but within minutes you can be in Greenwich and all that has to offer.  

We'll be back! Thank you so much."

After living in NYC for 6 years, I enjoy living with the people, not the tourist and this place was certainly a flavor of what it's like.  A short walk to many restaurants, pubs, the underground, Chelsea FC....just incredible. Do yourself a favor and stay here. Emily was super responsive and the kind of host that makes airbnb such a wonderful experience. "
8482299,260041388,03/05/2018,79797227,Brenda,"Anna's place is warm, clean and bright. The bedroom is lovely. We found the location very convenient for sightseeing easily. It is a short walk to Royal Oak bus stop where we caught a 36 bus to Buckingham Palace and on another day a connecting bus to the Victoria and Albert Museum and Harrod's. There are lots of things to see and do (think Portobello markets and old English pubs) within walking distance and no shortage of shops."

1891362,443657153,26/04/2019,237268488,Paul,"Spent a few days in London staying at Mark’s flat. We loved it. Mark is a wonderful host. He provided us with a small welcome gift, had fresh flowers on the table and awesome suggestions to help with our visit.  The flat is clean and spacious and very welcoming. Fantastic location with a five minute walk to Sloane Square station for the Underground. 
The only word of caution if considering Mark’s place would be the stairs down to the flat. If you have any physical limitations, you might want to look elsewhere as the stairs are narrow and steep.  
Otherwise, this flat is perfect for a London visit!"
14628902,592051500,12/01/2020,12632308,Malvína,"Great location, very clean place, comfortable bed. The room is a bit darker because it is in the basement with a window facing very small courtyard. The key system Klevio is clever but don't forget to always have your phone charged - if not, on the main street is a 24hours accessible charging point."

Her home was cosy, inviting and close enough to plenty of shops, deli's and transport links but set on a quiet, leafy street for a bit of quiet time.

46785931,722508884,07/01/2021,368421744,T,"Only stayed one night although we booked for a month, the place was not up to the standard as we expected.  
We are very clean people who take care of any place we go to and Simone’s place was the worse place we went to on Airbnb. There was too many stairs for me to climb since I’m pregnant and the kitchen and bathroom was absolutely filthy. The photos advertised was not the same once we got to the place. We kindly asked for a refund and the host declined even though we had photos and evidence to show he did not clean the place well. It was not good enough to a standard . He held onto the policy rules for dear life to justify why he could collect our money . 
My mistake was not reporting the unclean flat within 24/hours as my partner advised. I only reported the stairs and did not report the filthy flat because I thought Simone was pleasant enough to reimburse us if we left.
We did not know all the policy rules as we are new to Airbnb. But Unfortunately I was very wrong about Simone being considerate when he had the opportunity to be considerate.
Even Airbnb tried to ask Simone to have discretion and just refund us for the nights we did not stay with him and charge for the one night we stayed only. But simone declined......
Airbnb did say this below.... 

Airbnb Support 05:19
Any refunds at this point is at your host's discretion. I have requested and have sought his consideration to refund you the entire amount minus the two (2) nights. I hope and pray that he heeds to our request and that he set aside his cancellation policy. 
There's a couple of ways a refund can be processed, and as long as I am working on this matter, I will carry out the refund process on my end.


With the intervention of Airbnb we received a small compensation from them and not Simone. 
Even though we were not entitled to a refund because of the policy, Airbnb tried to get Simone to consider but he didn’t.
There is too many greedy host’s on Airbnb who only care about collecting your money rather then providing a service and maintaining an excellent reputation. I am done with Airbnb’s policy that seems to protect the host who is not even the one forking out money for these accommodations.
I felt reluctant to part my hard earned money after that ordeal....
I just want to thank the staff at Airbnb that tried very hard to reason with Simone and managed to give us something back themselves.
Thanks to manager Micheal and another female manager."

Around you can find a 24/7, a street market and a couple of bars where you can taste a real english breakfast. The only thing I have to notice is a little noise if you share the flat with other guests (but the walls and people's education are not Imi's fault...).

The flat was very well equipped with everything you need including hairdryer, kettle, coffee maker etc.  and Inge again thought to bring me a little milk for tea and had left sugar, tea, and so many more things.  It is a really comfortable place to stay and in a great area.  My one and only reservation was the noise of the road which for someone used to the quiet of the country took a little getting used to.  But of course Inge had thought to leave earplugs.  I would happily recommend Inge's little flat where you will be made to feel very at home. "

My room was clean and tidy but upstairs there is no heater. You can fell the difference from downstairs where is really really hot and upstairs. During the night I was freezing.

So I could quickly be in the hustle and bustle of central London, or go to the local shop for something to eat or to the nearby tavern for a pint. And I felt safe coming back late at night alone.  
Jude showed me the nearby park where we walked every morning as she filled me in with more details and info to enjoy my stay. Most of all, her warm hospitality made my stay really enjoyable.

It's the added special touches of coming home to find fresh bedding at the door a real treat!

위치는 바로 앞에 정류장이 있고 중심지와 이어져 있어 전혀 상관없었고 쇼파베드가 굉장히 넓어 편하였습니다.
난방도 굉장히 따뜻했으나 체크인할 당시 난방 시스템자체가 꺼져있어서 여차여차 틀었습니다. 주방 싱크대  오른쪽 위 케비넷을 열면 난방시스템이 있는데 스위치를 올려서 틀고 조정해야 난방 사용이 가능합니다.
화장실도 깨끗했고 불편함이 없었습니다.

문제가 있다면 주방 청결입니다. 일부 주방도구들이 관리가 되지않아 굉장히 더러웠고 커피포트 같은경우 사용하고 싶은 생각이 전혀 들지 않습니다. 그 밖에도 세탁기에도 열었을때 쓰던 걸레가 있어서 냄새가 났었구요 관리가 되지않아 저희가 다 씻고 청소해놨습니다.

I was out a lot as I was completing a course in the city, but the location was great. It was outside of the city so not in the middle of the hustle and bustle, but extremely convenient for travelling, with the bus stop outside the door and in 10 mins you are at the tube and into the centre of London in 20mins. As I was travelling by myself I found the area very safe. The room was very comfortable and cosy and beautifully directed. Thank you raimonda for making my first air bnb experience a great one! "

They felt really welcome from the moment Andy welcomed us to the house and showed us around. There were also loads of little personal touches that made the experience even better, like finding a fridge stocked with food and drinks, providing plug adaptors for visitors from other countries, a book full of top tips of things to see and do, and how to get there using public transport, and also a whole selection of games to keep the kids entertained. They also loved the bright London decor. It was perfect for a family trip to London. The location was perfect and easy to get both to our home nearby and into central London for sightseeing. Brian and Andy were so helpful in the run up to the arrival of our family, answering any questions we had and even sending us a special greeting on our wedding day. We would very much recommend this house for a group trip to London. It was perfect in every way!"

La chambre est située à quelques minutes à pied du métro, dans un quartier calme.
Pour la chambre, elle est comme décrite, dans le salon en fait. Donc pas de souci. Par contre problème pour moi au niveau de la propreté des lieux, cuisine et salle de bain, assez sommaire. Nous n'avons d'ailleurs pas du tout utilisé la cuisine et rapidemment la salle de bain,- Mais bon au vu du prix de la chambre...restons contents.

The shower was a bit small and didn't have the best water pressure, and the room was a bit chilly. I was out for most of the day, so this didn't affect my trip. This room would be great for friends travelling on a budget. The room was as described and quiet. I would definitely stay here again as its the perfect starting place to explore all of london."

Being summertime it was fantastic to be able to have the bi fold doors open and utilise the garden for our whole stay. Bedrooms and bathrooms are lovely. Note only 1 shower. This was not a problem for us and we had 4-5 adults staying. It's close to Clapham Junction station, plenty of restaurants , pubs and shops within walking distance. Quiet at night which was great. One note for those wanting to use hairdryers in the bathrooms !! No power, only shaver outlets in the bathrooms. 
I couldn't speak more highly of our experience at Jess's and we would definitely stay again .Thanks Jess :)))"

The only problem we had at first day—it was cold in apartment, but we solved it with help of support team. 
Notice—there is fire alarm testing every Friday at 11am. It’s not a problem, but just in case, if you like to wake up late. It lasts only few seconds. 
Also, it has super nice and friendly concierge service—they helped us with some issues."

It can be a little bit noisy at night (if you open the window for ventilation) as it's facing the main busy street but tolerable. A great place to stay provided you stay out most of the time and need a clean & decent bunk at a very convenient location."

The listing description was accurate, the room together with its bathroom was clean and tidy. The house is modern and well equipped. The neighbourhood is quiet, well apart of occasional plane departures from the nearby airport :), but that's only with open windows. You can get to the city centre pretty easily using the DLR or the underground accessible from the nearby stations. Overall, I was very satisfied. Thanks!"

There house is close to the Hyde Park so you can reach it quickly and have a walk. The Undergroundstation Knightsbridge is close by and a Lot of Cafes and Restaurants too, but their home is in a quiet street which was just perfect for the nights.

Battersea is a charming neighbourhood. The park is one of the most beautiful in London, and shops and restaurants are a few minutes walk away. There's no tube (underground) station nearby, but I used the public bikes (parked 1 minute from Sue's door) a lot, plus the buses are nearby and frequent. 

All in all, I highly recommend Sue's flat. "
1313531,29905900,14/04/2015,25266805,Sanju,"We had a great stay in London. Uros was very helpful in finding the address and welcoming us upon arrival. The room and bath room are clean and well kept. 
We slept at the street side. There is a market on the street so after 9am you'll have street noise which is no problem since we were not in the city to sleep the day away. 
There are towels, slippers, ear plugs, soaps and even candy. There is WiFi in the room.
At one point, when we were in Hyde Park, I noticed I lost my glasses, or so I thought. I called Uros who checked my room and the problem was solved. 
Conclusion: we were happy with our stay in London. Cozy Room is close to Liverpool Street and Aldgate. Wentworth street is very quiet between 9pm and 8am. The room is what you need. Uros is a great help and a guy whom you can trust. Thanks a lot, my friend."

Neigborhood is so quiet and peaceful. It's near to Little Italy canal. And it's so close to Warwick Av. tube station and 7/24 Tesco. I would recommend it to everyone.
23822953,529093779,14/09/2019,149831052,Stephanie,"The place should be cleaned up properly prior to check in. The towels were wet and smelled, the beds were poorly made, the comforters smelled, the carpet was stained, there was trash under the bed and behind the nightstand. The bathroom was very dirty with mildew around the faucet. There were balloons left inflated in the room. this was distasteful and not ok. When I reached out to you about my disability, you never responded about the room being on the second floor. When I mentioned there was a gas smell in the place, I also received no response."

It is convenient to Notting Hill, Portabello Market and the Westbourne Park underground station.  Therese was responsive to all my emails and requests.  You do need to walk up several flights of stairs -- this did not bother me but it may be an issue for someone else.  I would definitely stay here again."

It is quiet and homey, yet a short walk to the buzzing heart of Islington and all it's shops and restaurants. Equally wonderful, it's just a few blocks away from the canal we we spent an entire day walking through London. The bed is luxurious, and the kitchen is a cook's dream. And the garden -- when you open the kitchen doors and move in and out, it's like you've been transported from London directly into the Mediterranean.

Comfortable and inviting with everything we needed. The aged home is styled wonderfully and has a large garden just perfect for relaxing and meditating. Anne was away during our stay but Jenny was warm and accommodating and helped us with anything we needed. Brixton is a cool town with lots of excellent places to eat and shop. The Brixton Underground is 3 bus stops down from the house and all transport is easily accessible with an Oyster card which I highly recommend for the length of the stay. My kids loved Dino the house cat too. The cereal and breads and an array of honey, jam and marmalade made for a good start at breakfast and cups of tea and coffee were available all day.

You need to know, that there is no elevator/lift. Some outlets did not work. Bathrooms are very tiny. But the view to the neighbors houses are great."

no curtain on the living room window 
missing handles on some of the doors
show knob handle,  very slippery "

950998,14868579,28/06/2014,14268623,Laura,"Nic is a really nice guy, friendly & helpful. I think his flat is perfect for a couple or someone with older children. It has very easy access to Central London & feels very secure with a doorman present all day. My children were a little young so we couldn't let them sleep in the mezzanine bed area because we were worried they would climb and fall. Also Nic tried to sort out an extra key to get in downstairs for us but it didn't work out so of you are coming and going at different times be aware you may need to do some extra planning. We stayed for 8 days and there were 3 adults and 2 children for some of the time this was a little tight with lots of suitcases as it is a small flat and It has a lots of trinkets, clothes & suitcases in it. So shorter stays would work best unless you are happy to live out of your suitcase. The flat is exactly as it looks in the pictures but it could do with a deep clean. It is VERY close to Battersea Park which is gorgeous and it has a really lovely local coffee shop & a great Italian Bistro which Nic recommended to us. "
13954289,111190149,30/10/2016,14449347,Christina,"I chose the flat as I love the location after having stayed in the area for a couple of years. It's safe and conveniently located near to shops, restaurants, supermarkets and tube stations yet tucked in a corner. Proximity to parks is a bonus indeed besides easy access to motorway leading to the airport without having to go through the city traffic.

Nelly is very thoughtful and accommodating. She gladly allowed my daughter to stay a night and even invited her to stay till the evening after I have checked out even though technically a 3rd person is not allowed. 

As I was worried about lugging two suitcases up the flights of stairs, Nelly had the cleaners helped me even though they to stay extra hours as my flight was delayed.

Overall, the apartment was perfect for what we needed it for. However, it was on the smaller side which I believe it is quite common for London.
The area was pretty safe and walking distance from the tube, restaurants, etc.
It was great experience."

The house is authentic and well decorated, rooms are spacious and clean (beds are not huge but comfortable), breakfast is included and made of healthy and organic products (including excellent home made jams) and tea/coffe are available all day. Anne gave us excellent advices regarding London and Brixton in particular.  

Brixton in itself is a very interesting place with amazing places for food (see Brixton Village/Market row/Brixton Academy etc..) and is very well connected (Victoria Line and many buses to the center).

The place was very clean and comfortable ( bathtub, washing machine, fast internet, TV). Its located 5 min from the River Thames in a quiet neighbourhood. Around the building you find a very nice italian restaurant, a great lebanese place, some small bars and a Gordan Ramsey restaurant. It takes around 20 to 30min ( depending on traffic ) to victoria station. Chelsea is just across the bridge. We had a shopping and party stay planned in London - and it was just perfect for us. It takes some time to get to the most popular places in London - but the busride through the neighbourhood is just great ! Thanks Jill - we will be back :)"

The location was perfect for both my mother who is visiting from Australia and me who was finishing up work in Waterloo. My mother was at the foot step of nearly all the tourist attractions and made use of walking everywhere instead of catching transport. It was a very busy and positive experience for both of us. 
The facilities were great. Elizabeth was on hand at all times to answer questions and even went to the trouble to supply us with a new toaster (thank you!). 
We used both the double and blow up beds which were very comfortable and the stairs posed no problem, even for me, who was 32 weeks pregnant at the time.

He keeps his residence clean en shiny. That's what I liked the most. The breakfast is simple but good enough, a good start for a visit to London. I would definitely recommend Nev's place. Maybe less suitable for e.g. two girls travelling alone, because of the neighbourhood. If you do, I would recommend taking a cab to the residence, especially late at night. But all the rest was perfect. My husband and I enjoyed the WK Darts in Ally Pally. From Nev's residence Ally Pally is about half an hour travelling by tube (about 12 min walk to Manor House Station, about 10 min with the tube to Wood Green, about 12 min. walk from Wood Green to Ally Pally).

They are both eager to answer questions that you may have and are very knowledgeable about London, the surrounding area and how to get around on all modes of transportation. Breakfast is delicious and there is more offered than we could possibly eat! We felt at home and look forward to going back next year! In fact, given the hospitality of Gil and Peter, the access to every mode of transportation and comfort of the accommodations we will book here every time we come to London!"

I loves the localization, near the hip shoreditch and brick lane. The tube is 4 minutes walk from the place. Tay as a host is easy going and respondent quickly to all my messages."

However, the kitchen and bathroom looked like they haven't been cleaned in quite some time. Also, some things in the appartment were broken or falling apart (electricity outlets, cupboards,...). 
The check-in was uncomplicated and the communication upfront was very good. Overall our stay was alright but not super comfortable."

The room was nice and bright, and Ivana put care into all the little details like a coaster by the bed, nice hangers, etc. I was impressed with her selection of teas and breakfast foods, and shower gels! Highly recommended and would stay there again."

9600864,506923114,11/08/2019,39506277,Michael,"Spent 7 nights at this townhouse and  found it to be exactly as advertised. Very clean with a modern decor, and the beds were super comfy. Every appliance worked well from the kitchen to the laundry room. A great bonus was the small garden are in the back of the unit. Used it more than expected, it was a great place to unwind and chill out after a long day of sightseeing.  Location was fantastic, just a short walk away from the Angel tube station. The area had lots of wonderful restaurants, pubs, multiple supermarkets and even a modern cinema complex. The only very minor issue I had was with internet access. While there was a strong wifi signal on all four floors, the speed was very slow at all hours of the day, indicating that there is some sort of issue with the ISP that is used. Should be quite easy to fix this for future guests. But overall a great stay, and would not hesitate to book again should I return to London."

It has two small rooms (one including a kitchenette with a stove and a fridge) and a small bathroom.  It is very nice, comfortable and clean, and Inge fitted it with everything one might need for a pleasant stay.  Also, in the kitchen there were ample breakfast, tea and coffee supplies.

It is obvious that Kevin has made a concerted & special effort to include an eclectic mix of entertainment as far as music, reading material etc. It is also so close to eating establishments & the local shopping centre.

Located near the South Kensington and Gloucester Tube stops on a quiet
street in an upscale area of London (my son and I played punch-Ferrari instead of punch-buggy while walking down the street), there is plenty to see and do nearby and well as diversity of restaurants.  Check-in and check-out were a breeze.  My wife, son, and I would definitely return to this flat for any future stays in London."

Along the way to his place, you will pass by numerous groceries, eateries of various price range, Morrison's which is just across the street from the tube station, and there is even a local kosher shop nearby. The place is quiet, clean, has good natural lighting, a well-equipped kitchen and charming living room with many books. Luke is very friendly and helpful, and plays the cello (a bonus if you like good music and if you play any musical instrument). He is a very interesting person to talk to, and gave good suggestions as to where to eat, shop, and nearby places worth sightseeing. He is a proponent of healthy eating and has a good selection of tea at his place (he has decaffeinated tea and chamomile tea, in addition to the morning teas, which I felt was really thoughtful and made me feel very much welcomed). I stayed there for a week with my husband and we thoroughly enjoyed our stay there. Definitely worth staying at Luke's place in London!"

Paul and Angela were excellent communicators and very responsive to our questions.  The location of the flat is perfect!  It is just a short five minute walk from Waterloo Station which gives you access to all of London by subway (tube) or train.  We found two great places to eat just a couple walking minutes away.  The first is called Balance - great food and great service.  The second was La Barca which was one of the best Italian restaurants we have ever eaten at!! And we have eaten at many across the globe.  You cannot go wrong with this place if you want to truly experience the great city of London.  We feel lucky to have found such a place.  We highly recommend this flat and its owners Angela and Paul.  We will stay there again when we go back.  Maybe we can best sum up our entire experience with this:  ""WOW!!!!"""

Right up the street is The Quince Cafe at Clifton Nurseries and we ate there three mornings. Great food and ambiance.  The beds and bed linens were clean and comfortable and the shower was also great with hot water available any time.  The toilet is a bit delicate and it clogged one time but it fixed itself by the next morning. We were there in January and the heat worked great as well.  The kitchen could use a bit of TLC. The fridge had a strong mildew odor and there was some water coming up from the floor boards so we didn't use the kitchen much.  Having said that,  Liz's team was quick to respond to the issues we were having."

Les équipements sont de qualité, la propreté irréprochable, l'environnement très paisible, la déco simple mais soignée. A deux pas du métro, DLR, l'overground, l'emplacement est idéal pour partir vers vos excursions dans Londres. Le quartier est tranquille, des commerces sont à quelques secondes pour un dépannage. Pour des courses plus complètes, prévoyez de trouver un supermarché avant de revenir à l'appartement. Alison n'a pas été présente à notre arrivée mais nous avons échangé par téléphone, sms, ses indications étaient très claires, le contact très convivial. Elle s'est inquiétée de savoir si nous étions bien arrivés à l'appartement. Nous étions 3 personnes (un couple + 1) et les deux salles de bain permettent à chacun d'avoir son intimité. Toilettes dans chacune des salles de bain. Nous avons pris nos repas chaque soir dans l'appartement. Il y a assez de vaisselle, casseroles, poêles, etc... pour se préparer des plats simples. Je recommande vivement cette location qui mérite amplement son prix et retournerai probablement chez Alison une prochaine fois. Félicitations et remerciements à Alison !"

The neighbourhood is very nice and calm. the house is big, clean, confortable, we had the first floor with private bathroom and wc, the kitchen is just beside.

It is a top floor flat that has been made over into one that would qualify to be featured in Architectural Digest.  Modern, clean lines, making the most from the the views and available light.  High quality linens, plenty of hot water,  WiFi that flawlessly worked, immaculate condition, location to the Heath, birdsong in the mornings, skyline views of London at night from the little terrace in the master bedroom, a large wooden kitchen table...these are what we appreciated the most.  It was a lovely home base that was also fun to call “home” for a week."

The coach house feels very new and had everything we needed. Melanie left some breakfast treats and there was also some tea/coffee, salt/pepper etc which not every place has but it was definitely appreciated. The area itself is in a very clean and safe area of London surrounded by residential streets and parks in either direction. It is not too far away from some local shops and pubs as well. Communication and flexibility in check-in was great. I'd recommend Melanie's coach house to anyone."

We made good use of the laundry facilities, WiFi and coffee machine. There is a bus stop outside the house and a train station 10mins walk away. Buy yourself a travel card as it is easiest way to get into central London - about 30mins - 40mins to most places. We were a short walk from Portobello Rd, and had a huge range of dining options, especially on market days. Our host kept in touch before and during our stay, and Roche was on site when we got there to help us settle in, and a phone call away for the whole stay."

Great location, close to the underground. Big park across the road, great for a sunny day. Plenty of shops and restaurants all within walking distance.
As described, had the fourth floor to myself which had everything anyone would need. There was a small fridge, microwave and kettle. 
The ensuite was actually a full bathroom, with bathtub as well which was a nice surprise! The room was perfect and the bed very comfortable. 
Was just an overall lovely stay, with lovely people and I look forward to staying with them again."

Nous voici de retour à la maison. Notre séjour chez toi était agréable et rassurant, de part ta présence régulière, ton accueil et ton tempérament dynamique et serviable. Ton appartement est dans un quartier calme et peu éloigné du centre peuplé de Touristes !

The double-room was perfect for our journey, not only are this double-room and the private bathroom well-furnished but also located in the flat in a way that you do feel independant. You don't fear to disturb one another's privacy. Khaled works mainly during evening or night but both Khaled and Geraldine were quiet and discreet so that we were never disturbed while they were coming back home.  Me and my friend definitely recommend this place and would be glad to stay there again for a next stay in London."

Good location right in East St market close to plenty of buses and a 5-10 min walk from elephant & castle for the tube and train.

13917843,303358099,07/08/2018,4802038,Sonja,"Huma's home is absolutely fabulous, an absolute delight.  From the moment you walk in the front door, it is a sea of tranquility in the craziness that is London.  

Huma's communication is excellent, directions very clear and she was very responsive to all questions.  The home is close to Stockwell underground station, next to two grocery stores, a great coffee shop and a few yoga studios.  It really is in an ideal location.

The home itself is fabulous, my room was on the 1st floor, it was delightfully and thoughtfully furnished as is the entire house.  The room as spacious and extremely clean.  The home is sparkling clean!  The garden at the back of the house is an added bonus, a really beautiful place to have breakfast or an evening relaxing.  There is also a terrace off the living area which is a great place to relax.

There is nothing I can fault, nothing.  The kitchen is well equipped, spacious and new.  Absolutely beautiful.  There are a number of bathrooms and all are sparkling and clean.  You have absolutely everything you could need for a long or short stay.

The three cats are an added bonus, I absolutely fell in love with all three of them who have such individual personalities.  

Great location, great communication, beautiful home, wonderful place for a short or long stay.  Huma has it all covered, if you are able to book Huma's home you are very fortunate."

The neighborhood is super cute with excellent food and drink options, 5 mins from Borough Market, and the station close by. I really enjoyed walking around the neighborhood and exploring the cafes and shops. Tower bridge was only 8 mins away and a great way to stretch my legs. Ana was an amazing host and kindly made us coffee before we left, so we could chat and get to know each other. The accommodation itself was very spacious, well-lit, sparkling clean, and with thoughtful artistic touches. I really can't recommend this place enough! I'm definitely coming back."

Disponibilité, compétences, aide pour trouver des solutions et gentillesse, juste parfait !
Que dire de l’appart ..... situé dans une rue à la fois typique et dans un quartier vivant avec pubs, restaurants, etc. 
Leur studio est d’une propreté impeccable et rempli d’attentions (liste de bons plans, bouquins ....), linge de maison propre et frais, café, thé, porridge pour pouvoir prendre un petit dej sur place et superbe déco.

L'accès est très pratique depuis la gare par métro ou bus avec des arrêts proches. Ma préférence va pour les bus car plus sympa pour découvrir la ville.
La chambre avec toilette et lavabo est très bien et très calme car donne sur rue (prévoir un masque pour les yeux pour ceux sensibles à la lumière car les rideaux ne sont pas occultant).
Le quartier est sympa (nous n'y sommes pas restés longtemps), rentrés le soir sans problème et le matin un petit dej typiquement anglais dans un pub à côté :).
Merci à Alizée et Tom pour les petits conseils sur les bus et quartiers où se balader."

There's a water machine - not sure what it is, but seems to have something to do with water - in one of the room's cabinets that can be a bit noisy sometimes. The view from the window is great! And the kitchen has instant hot water for tea, very convenient. As for the location, just like one previous review said, the area is full of hills, so be aware if you have heavy luggage. Also, the house is located about 15 minutes walk away from the train/overground stations. If traveling with public transport, it would be better to take bus. Many bus stops around the house with short walking distance. Overall a nice and clean place, good value considering a room in London!"

The building is right next to the railway line and the trains go by regularly but to be quite honest, it didn't really bother us.  Sometimes low-flying planes did intrude on our peace.  But generally a nice place."
26439752,322798752,14/09/2018,62287579,Glenn,The flat was really nice. But i had an issue that I couldn’t get the tv to work. I asked the agency who was looking after the flat they told me to email some one and I got a reply back saying “bet that’s frustrating” not helpful at all. So yes the flat is nice but the people running it wont help you if you need them. Luckily i was only there for a few nights. I wont be returning

There's a bit of traffic noise in this area, but it's so convenient with supermarkets and restaurants all around, so that's just the balance of staying in an inner city location. Maggie was always responsive and did a wonderful job of looking after us - particularly as we arrived a few hours early. I would certainly recommend this property to a couple or family of 4."
35187786,546879856,14/10/2019,49901036,Jacqui,"We really enjoyed our week long stay. The location is stellar - super easy to catch transport and Dalston itself is filled to the brim with plenty to see/eat/experience. Despite being quite cosy the flat is super comfortable. Nice pillows, mattress, shower pressure etc. The wifi in the room was also very fast and consistent. Overall great value for money and having the cafe downstairs for a morning cuppa was tops."

Our flat in Kensington was terrific and very close to the underground station, Gloucester Road. Our host Stefania was very prompt in her email reply and was very helpful. She coordinated our arrival superbly even though we were confused and were late from our flight. We ended up picking up the keys at a local restaurant. I thought it was a great start of our adventure. The flat was clean, neat and comfortable. The kitchen and bathroom was modern and the appliances took a bit to decipher the instructions. All in all, a great place to stay in London. Centrally located, a great value. Thank you for being so helpful. We appreciated it Stefania.  "

First: the host. Our plane to London was delayed by over 3 hours, but Harry was unperturbed, waiting to greet us and hand over the keys *and* an insanely detailed packet of information answering any and all questions we might have about the flat during our stay. When we needed to contact him regarding an issue with the housekeeper, he was prompt and communicative, even though he was vacationing in another country at the time!

Second: the penthouse. After full days of taking in all the sights and sounds of London, it was an incredible relief to return to the privacy and comfort of the flat. The views in the photos are not exaggerated, and we spent many relaxing evenings on the deck. The location couldn't have been better: across the water and away from the frenetic city life of London, but ~5 minutes max to the nearest Underground station and a quick ~10 minute walk to the nearest gym. The 24 hour grocery store attached to the building was also hugely convenient. The penthouse was jammed full the the latest technology and amenities, and the quality of the furnishings was top-notch.

If you're on the fence about booking this place, don't be. Follow our lead and have an unforgettable, stress-free trip to London."

She told us the easiest way to get to the house from the airport and than recommended a great place to eat after we arrived. She had left us fresh bread, milk and jam which was a very nice detail and since our bus was late at night she let us keep our luggage at the house after check-out so that we could tour around freely. House is very nicely decorated, and in a nice neighborhood close to the central line. Beds were really comfy and the sheets were very clean. The house was overall clean and tidy and had everything one might need in his/her stay. Definitely recommend."

The house is in a good location for traveling into the centre of London....... Dollis Hill tube station is a couple of  minutes walk.. and the tube got me into the centre of London in 10 to 15 minutes. Shops are also nearby.. so it is easy to fix a meal in the kitchen.. which was always clean. My sleep quality was good.. and the house was quiet and peaceful.

The room and bathroom were spotlessly clean and very stylish/modern. The room itself was very well-equipped with kettle, coffee machine, fridge, hairdryer, fan and more. The bed was extremely comfortable too! It was better than most hotels I've stayed in so would highly recommend if you're looking for a private room/bathroom with great amenities and in a fantastic location."

The room and bathroom were exactly as pictured (the bathroom was even better because the tub was huge) and I really felt so comfortable. Coming in by train it wasn't the most convenient to get to initially, but I only had a small weekend bag so it could have been a bit more difficult trying to navigate the streets if I had larger luggage. The best bit was that it felt like a real home with kid's shoes at the top of the stairs and chalk art on the blackboard. I didn't worry about being loud walking around after the kids went to bed or rude for sleeping in. Highly recommended and I'd definitely stay again!"
25872901,288266224,09/07/2018,35371204,Lorenzo,Sam is a good host. Position is fantastic to visit London.

A room for the parents, and a comfortable pull out bed for the kids. The space was bright and well appointed, just like her listing suggests. Very short walk to the bus station and a great little health food store just around the corner."

25116142,443144077,25/04/2019,175246271,David,"Great host. Apartment was wonderful. Love the neighborhood having been there with family. But what made this so remarkable was what greeted me at the door. I’m a West Ham United supporter, a football club in London. Darcy knew that from our communications. So what did he do? He borrowed a framed, signed jersey/kit from the 1980 West Ham team that won the FA Cup and hung it on the wall. If that’s not over the top hospitality I have no idea what is. No question I’ll be back."
17359596,143947140,14/04/2017,120326539,Daniel,"It's a quiet, stylish jewel. The appliances are of great quality. The hosts, Pia and Esme, are very kind and welcoming. I would love to book it again. To get anywhere you have to walk for 2 min to the nearby bus stop. From there it's a 10min  bus ride to Victoria Station from which you will be able to connect to any point in London comfortably. I recommend checking out the nearby crowne plaza hotel where you can have breakfast or drinks while watching helicopters take off at the heliport."

The only negatives, the room was too hot, so you either roasted or opened the windows which then let all the traffic noise in (loud motorbike exhausts). Unfortunately the aircon is centrally controlled, so you can not change it to suit yourselves."

La décoration est superbe et de qualité .C’ est très proche de la gare donc facile avec des bagages . Néanmoins certains aspects comme la moquette crème difficile avec des enfants, la salle de bains non rénovée , le quartier et l’ immeuble peu cosy, le manque de fournitures dans la cuisine ...font que je recommanderai ce logement plutôt pour un très court séjour. Même si au calme , pas de petits restaurants ou bars sympas dans le quartier , il faut prendre les transports quoique vous fassiez  ."

Jack is a great host, he brought us some food because we arrived at Boxing Day, and he answerd all our requiests very quickly."

Easy to get connecting transport into Central London. The bus stop is just in front of the house on the return journey. Love it. Our kids like to play with Gizmo (Rachel's pet rabbit) when we are in the apartment. Thanks Rachel for allowing us to stay there.  Would love to be back again for another stay when visiting London.

The weekend worked out fine. 5 mins from centre of happenings, no taxi fares, no extra cost to victualling as we brought our own and no late night travelling home. Having you at the end of the phone and meeting us on arrival was very rewarding in relaxing our first experience. One of many. Thank you"

As we entered the room the clean sheets and towel were already awaiting on the comfortable bed. And the kitchen! hard to find second like that in London! In positive way of course."

I didn't get to know him very well since he left almost after my arrival but he was very helpful in giving instructions and explaining what was necessary to do for a pleasant stay in the flat. I also had a problem with the keys and he was extremely present and available when I called him to solve the issue, even if he was on holidays, which shows that he really cares about the hosts and their stay.

Ben is a great host, very flexible and responds quickly. Thanks"
698606,223489802,01/01/2018,1686809,Mayan,"Really loved our stay in this space. We were a little cognizant about noise because it seems like sounds traveled through the home quite easily. The bathroom is stunning and well stocked to make for a wonderful and relaxing time. Chisick itself is quite lovely and nice to be out of the hustle of the central part of the city, though travel time is increased when going into the tourist areas. Overall, I would reccomend!"

1532025,472721682,20/06/2019,157677863,Tanja,Wir hatten einen tollen Aufenthalt in deiner Emilys Wohnung. Besonders hervorheben möchten wir die tolle Anbindung an die Underground-Station Belsize-Park. Trotz der nah gelegenen Underground Station war die Unterkunft absolut ruhig und wir konnten bei voll geöffneten Fenstern schlafen ohne irgendein Verkehrslärm zu hören. Die Matratze war hervorragend und wir haben selbst in einem Hotel noch kein besseres Bett vorgefunden  als bei Emily. Wir kommen definitiv wieder und werden mit Sicherheit erneut bei Emily übernachten.

511913,1868666,02/08/2012,1748210,Bailey,"The room is as tiny as it looks in the picture, but don't mistake lack of size for lack of comfort! For one person with a carry-on size bag and backpack worth of luggage, it was perfect. There are shelves and a smallish set of drawers, and there are drawers under the bed. I didn't mind not having very much floor space, as I didn't end up spending a lot of time in the room during my stay.
This room is also very conveniently located about 3-5 minutes walk to the nearest bus stop, and from there about a 7-10 minute bus ride to the tube station (South Wimbledon on the Northern Line). If you needed to walk from the tube station for whatever reason, it's really not as far as it seems--a cab can be a ripoff!

James is a very kind host who really does care about his guests. I enjoyed staying with him very much."

5725042,337998663,18/10/2018,28502749,Kayla,"Kind and warm greetings when we arrived, but the photos made it seem like a room in a private home. But when we arrived, it was more of a hotel or hostel. It was surprisingly loud for a weeknight, though we realize that isn’t the fault of the host. But we did need to keep the television on to drown out the noise coming from outside. Just note this isn’t just a room in a standard private home or a bed and breakfast."

9568054,70352304,17/04/2016,7942286,Zala,"Me and my friends stay at Katja's and Lorenzo's place for 4 days. The flat is super nice, tidy and spacious enough for 4 people, but it could easily host up to 6 people. The location is very convenient as well - there's a bus station right in front of the house, the buses run every few minutes, so you can easily travel to wherever in the city.

Katja and Lorenzo were out of town when we arrived but Katja was friendly enough to provide us with detailed information on how to get into the flat and how to navigate around the city. She communicated beautifully before our trip and she even put post-it notes around the flat on how to use the utilities or where to find the kitchen essentials (like tea, coffee etc.).

Katja and Lorenzo came back from their trip on our last day in London - we didn't meet Katja, since she was tired from a long trip and went to sleep, but we had a chat with Lorenzo, who was extremely friendly and made us feel even more welcome.

All in all, we were more than happy with everything. We're sure we couldn't have found a better place to stay and would definitely recommend Katja's and Lorenzo's flat to anyone visiting London."

The room is very well appointed and great for a short stay in London. They provided a small amount of food for breakfast which was just great too--very handy, especially after a long flight from Australia and jet lag. It's excellent value for money, especially as I was working the week at the National Archives, which is mere minutes away. I cannot recommend this place enough."

The flat had everything we needed and more, and Victoria made us feel very welcome and was always contactable to answer any questions we had. Great location as well, just a short stroll down into town or the local train station, which links directly into central London.

375006,12349072,29/04/2014,14075249,Faustine,"Hello, 
We spent 3 days in London and stayed at Tope's place. Tope is really really friendly and always happy to help. His flat is well located as very near to almost every interesting tourist places. In the meantime I must say that the area is very humid and that you can smell humidity in the room. It is also very close to the rail station and we had to wait until the last train was gone to fall asleep. I would recommend you the place if you do not wish to spend your day or your evening at home."
13162865,269877730,28/05/2018,53893900,Alex,"Nicolas' flat beat every one of my expectations and was the perfect place to stay for a 6 day trip to London with my girlfriend. The location is incredible, right across from the tower bridge and with tons of great food and drink within walking distance. Going further into London is easy too. The London Bridge underground is a short walk, or multiple bus stops out the front door that will take you wherever you want to go.

The area is relatively quiet at night and any street noise on the weekend wasn't bad considering the flat is on the 5th floor. The flat itself was very clean and spacious. All the furniture was both stylish and comfortable, especially the bed!

Truely an amazing way to experience London. Thank you Nicholas."

My husband and I found it very comfortable and well stocked with everything we needed to make our stay enjoyable.  The neighbourhood is conveniently located and there is a tube station less than a five minute walk away which allows for easy access to all the sights and attractions London has to offer.  Be sure to check out the lovely park directly across the street from the flat, Highgate Village (a quick ten minute walk away), as well as The Woodman pub by the tube station exit. We would book again."

The room is like what it is shown on the Airbnb, clean and cozy. 
Helen is nice and she introduced an useful website (Website hidden by Airbnb) to me for London's transportation guide. 
The location is quite convenient that I walk to the tube station for 4 mins and there's a bus stop just in front of the building.
Thank you Helen!"

We stayed at Anna's flat for two weeks over the new year period. The flat is homely and very clean. We felt comfortable and settled in straight away.

Anna was always on hand if we needed her and replied back to us straight away when we wanted to extend our stay.

The pictures don't do her home justice and her home is much bigger than the photos look.

We would stay at Anna's home again and would recommend her to anyone."

The room is bright and the shared bathroom is clean. 
Jacqueline welcomed me and said goodbye to me in person. She was nice to me and explained the surrounding area when I arrived. She even invited me for joining her the Friday Sabbath Dinner. 

P.S.: You have to follow her strict kitchen rules if you choose her house. Please make sure you don't need to cook during your stay. She offers to cook dinner for guest with little charge. "

From day one they made me feel at home and there was always time for some good talks in the house. The room was very light, clean and big. I loved that I had a big closet for all my stuff and that there is a little couch for yourself. It is also very easy that you sleep on the ground floor, so your room is a bit more private if you need that. Rachel told me all of her favourite places to go to and showed me how to get there on the map. The Victoria park around the corner or the canals nearby are perfect for a run(or walk). And Londens best (sunday)markets are on walking distance from the house. I can’t wait to come back here ❤️"

It was within a 10 minute walk of 2 tube stations. The bed was comfy but I didn’t realise beforehand that it was a sofa bed and, therefore, I didn’t have any sitting area. I don’t think this was made clear on the photos. There was no tv, but I didn’t check this so that’s my fault. The lack of wardrobe was an issue because I was travelling on business and couldn’t hang my clothes, and the lack of WiFi was a big negative. Zvonko was very pleasant and met me as agreed (although there was no response to my first message) but I definitely feel that WiFi, locked wardrobes etc could have been explained better. All in all, the cleanliness and security made for a good stay but not excellent and definitely not luxury."

It is their home when guests don't stay and so it was so lovely to spend time in a comfortable, interesting and well-loved space. It is small, as described, but it is unique, it has more than everything you need and is super-comfortable. The location is awesome, Camden Passage is really cool and on the doorstep of Upper Street and all of Islington's delights. And Johnny went out of his way to help us out with dropping bags off early and picking them up late. Thank you!"

If you are sensitive to noise, you may find its location next to a main set of train tracks coming into London disturbing, even with the triple glazing.  Good communication.  We encountered some issues with the state of the apartment when we arrived.  Most of them were fixed quickly.

You'll find most foodstuff you need in the small supermarket in the complex, or in stores within 1/2 mile.

Beware of the lift, it's old, small and plays up. Take the stairs to not risk getting stuck inside (not fun) 
All in all was a fairly good stay"

We late booked, they moved mountains to accommodate us in every aspect, the appt is quite, immaculately clean and very well run. The accommodation is better than you expect from that price range, it’s fantastic transport links, in fact we found it so suitable we have just rebooted now again for two nights as our plans changed and are looking to make a maybe much longer booking in the very near future, 
For simp,e uncomplicated and well connected accommodations you will have to go a long way, the owners Helen and house keeper Annie Marie are super stars and nothing is too much trouble.

Nous avons été très bien accueillies par le mari de Deirdre qui parle français, ce qui peut être d'une grande aide. Chambre propre et fonctionnelle. Il est très facile de se rendre dans le centre de Londres : 35 minutes de la maison à Victoria. Cependant, un manque de communication avec nos hôtes nous a mises à l'aise, notamment pour le petit déjeuner puisque nous ne savions pas ce que nous pouvions consommer. Rien n'était mis en évidence sur la table. Nos hôtes étant indisponibles, nous n'avons pu éclaircir ce point. signal wifi faible dans la chambre. "

We had such a brilliant weekend in London and the apartment played a big part in that! Kevis was efficient at responding, friendly and very welcoming and also really flexible with times etc which made us feel really at ease for the weekend. The apartment was perfect for what we were after and the place was new, smart and very clean. There were great views from the balcony and the light coming in made you feel like you were outside :) The area was exactly what we wanted, having been there before, and the apartment itself was in a quiet, safe place. We were right in the middle of the Brixton life but you couldn't hear a peep when you were tucked up in what I can only describe as the comfiest bed ever!

The room was clean with empty closets to store our clothes (and hangars!) - also a much-needed sink. Mind you, this is a hostel so you will share two toilets and two shower stalls with about 3 other rooms. We never had an issue waiting for toilets or shower. Also, while it is marketed as a triple room - the third cot had missing slats in the frame making for an uncomfortable sleep. A small inconvenience given the great location and strong WiFi - would recommend for travelers looming for good value in a good location who won’t spend much time in the rooms.

14812944,316548691,31/08/2018,191520292,Matt,"What an amazing place! Situated in cool and vibrant Brixton, about 15-minuted walk from Brixton underground, this is the perfect place to stay.
The room is large and airy with a comfy sofa to sit in beside a full-length window and watch the sun go down. The bed is very comfortable and the room has other great touches such as a fridge, tea & coffee, guide books on London, a small library of other books and, situated at the top of the house it’s extremely quiet. It also has fast WiFi. A great bonus is the en-suite which again is spacious, clean and has an excellent shower.
Catherine was a great host, her communication was quick and efficient and the self check-in simple.
The area is near parks, on great bus routes and there is a Tesco Express and Sainsbury’s Local very close by in addition to countless bars, cafes and restaurants.
The walk to the underground is flat and very safe.
There’s little more I can say really: this is the perfect place to stay and I hope to be back very soon."

11786394,519759833,29/08/2019,159712571,Kelly,"If you don't mind stairs and don't have young children, book this place immediately.  Our family (with older children) had a wonderful week in London here.
The flat is perfect because:
Space--the main floor is full of light (3 skylights) and stylishly decorated with a fully-stocked kitchen (including washer/dryer), the bedrooms are one floor below (good for privacy), there is an updated bathroom w/ a small sitting area outside its window (shielded from the wind in case the roof garden is too cold), and WOW!, an amazing private roof garden with 360 degree views.  It was unusually warm during part of our week there, but the bedrooms were still cool, there was a good fan for the main floor, and there was always a breeze on the roof.  The internet is fast and strong, w/ 2 different routers.
Location--It's on the Victoria line (frequent trains) 4 minutes from the Pimlico stop and 12 minutes from Victoria station.  The #24 bus stops 50 feet from the front door and goes to many of the sights (Westminster, Buckingham Palace, British Museum).  It's also easy to walk to the Thames and many tourist sights.  Pimlico is a safe, charming neighborhood with great restaurants and pubs, although we ordered or cooked in most nights so we could watch the sunset from the roof garden.  
Hosts--they responded quickly and completely, and were very accommodating with our check-in and out times.  They provide great advice in the house manual and neighborhood guide.  They also stock the flat with all necessities, including toiletries, tea & spices, and games to play on the roof (we loved the drinking Jenga game and travel Scrabble).  Our vacation was much more memorable because of this charming flat--I would highly recommend it!"

Eddies Wohnung ist in einer ruhigen Wohnstraße eines lebhaften, interessanten Viertels gelegen, in dem viele Kulturen aufeinander treffen.
Man braucht von hier eine Weile bis zu den großen Touristenattraktionen, aber die Busfahrten fühlen sich auch ein bisschen wie Sightseeing an und nach vielen Stunden des Herumlaufens, kann man es auch sehr gut genießen mal zu sitzen und zu entspannen. 
Das Zimmer ist ein gut geeigneter Rückzugsort und Ruhepol nach den vielen Eindrücken des geschäftigen Treibens der Stadt."

Helen took extra time to make sure we could get around. She saved us money on the transportation and provided everything for a comfortable stay including snacks coffee tea chilled water and an electrical converter.  The flat was fresh and remodeled. It was a very convenient location"

802401,3459086,02/02/2013,4598712,Sophie,"We had a lovely time in this apartment and enjoyed it very much. Martin was really thoughtful and helped us with anything we needed. The apartment is spacious, especially for London. We were 4 people and had no trouble fitting and making ourselves comfortable in the apartment. The place is in a nice quite street (the other side is a bit loud due to the traffic on the main road) and just a 8 minutes walk from central line. To get to Oxford Circus takes approximately 25 minutes, which is great for London. The big shopping mall is also very convenient, since it hosts the largest movie theatre I have ever seen and all the shops you can think of. 
Finally, the place is great for a business trip or just a holiday in London. If you miss anything in the apartment, Martin is always there for you to fix it or help you out! 

Enjoy staying there! It feels a little bit like you are in the movie Notting Hill :) "
16241461,567758356,23/11/2019,230455992,Cassandra,"While Amanda is lovely and the place is definitely charming, I didn’t have the 5 star experience of many others before me. I feel it’s important to mention that I did stay in Amanda’s place for a month, so some of the things that made this experience worse for me, may not be relevant/applicable for people staying a shorter amount of time. 

One of the things that struck me as a huge red flag was that Amanda entered the flat during my stay (when I was meant to have the entire place to myself) at 8pm while I was in bed. I’d been made aware that she would be dropping by - but just to leave an extra heater at the door, not that she would be entering the flat. I was sick on this occasion, half asleep in bed when she knocked on the door, and said she just needed to pick something up. This felt like a major invasion of my privacy given that I was only half dressed, sick, and also in bed at the time. I feigned not hearing her enter and waited 5 minutes before venturing out to see that she had already left. 

The second thing that irked me was when Amanda accidentally sent a package to the flat’s address instead of her work address. This in itself would be fine, but the follow up from this wasn’t. I was asked to look out for the package and answer the door if I was at the flat when it was delivered, which was fine, but upon telling her that I hadn’t been there and that there was a delivery slip saying the package was with her neighbour, she asked me to go knock on his door and get it from him. This was on a Friday night at 7:30. I wasn’t even in the flat, and this wasn’t even *my* neighbour. In my opinion it wasn’t appropriate to ask this of me. 

The only other issue I had during my time at Amanda’s was the general hygiene of the flat. Due to the amount of stuff in the flat, there is a large amount of dust, which is accompanied by little dust mites that can be seen crawling along surfaces. 

Like I said at the start, Amanda (and her dogs) are lovely. The photos are also accurate, and the price that I paid was reasonable, but these experiences negatively impacted my stay."

Beautiful cat is another bonus!

Our main disappointment was that there were building works going on the first two days of our stay, which meant being woken early from about 7am those days and not being able to relax in the rooms. When we told our host this he basically brushed us off saying you’ve got to expect this in a busy city. He never checked during our stay to see if it had stopped. He begrudgingly offered some small compensation at the end of the trip but only because we asked. It was a disappointing end to our stay there."

But on the brighter side, not only Richie is nice host, but his dad (who is living with him) is one of the nicest person I have met for a long time!"

31777329,476080070,25/06/2019,904479,Noa,Great location and spotless place. Small and a shared kitchen but totally worth it for the quality of the room and amazing location.
13413641,664834249,16/09/2020,178774190,Ellie,"Had a really lovely few days stop over in London at Uma’s place. Her home was super clean and she was very hospitable, offered me a tea as soon as I got there and provided all the necessary bits I needed! Felt very safe, at home and comfortable in the quiet area that was also close enough to local amenities and transport links. Really enjoyed my stay and I highly recommend Uma’s place to anyone! Thank you so much x"
27634119,457975809,25/05/2019,20694914,Kayla,"I think if there were a little bit more time prepare, perhaps this place would have lived up to expectations. We had to stay at Nina's place very last minute and they were all very accommodating. Our wifi never did work and it was missing little touches (like coffee) that I think now we've come to expect Airbnb's to provide. As I said though, this was very last minute so I think given more time to prepare Nina and her team would have delivered. The photos are a little different than presented. The photos on this listing present a home that is fully furnished and looks cozy. In reality, it looks like someone just moved in or moved out. Don't get me wrong, this is a beautiful place —just feels a little unfinished. The location is great. Very walkable and 5-minute walk from the tube. I will say that these folks were very accommodating and are easy to get a hold of. Lastly, I would recommend this place for a large group (it was just two of us) it's very spacious!"
6479011,421316366,09/03/2019,238447328,Eno Abena,"Melanie was very communicative before hosting us and was available when we arrived as well. Her home is located in a quiet neighbourhood that's a convenient walk to the Hammersmith Station and Thames River. Our room was as advertised, and our host kindly offered us tea/coffee ahead of our dawn departure. Unfortunately our room was not warm enough so we asked for the heat to be turned on which she obliged. However, it was still colder than we had anticipated. Other than that we had an uneventful stay."

Tenemos que decidir que su apartamento no podría estar en mejor lugar, a 10 min del metro con combinación a todas las atracciones turísticas de Londres y al aeropuerto. El barrio, Hammersmith es muy bonito y cerca de su casa hay una cafetería donde puedes ir a desayunar por la mañana y un supermercado Tesco donde puedes comprar algo de comida si ese día prefieres comer algo en casa.
El apartamento es ideal para una pareja, amplio y con un gran gusto para la decoración. 
Patrick ha sido muy atento y nos ha ayudado en todo, en definitiva ha sido una experiencia inmejorable. 
Muchas gracias, volveremos seguro!!"

The place is 10 minutes from the station and then the train takes 10 minutes to reach Victoria station (central area, near Buckingham palace). Everything is as describe. We did not have the opportunity to meet Becky but she is so nice ! She helps us a lot from preparing our trip to the time we get back home. She prepares a place so that we feel at home with everything needed at disposition. My friends and me strongly recommend Becky as a host and we do look forward to come back to London and to have the opportunity to meet you. We wish you all the best :)"

In pochi minuti si arriva a Holland Park Av., una via principale, e da lì ci si può spostare con i mezzi pubblici. Si raggiungono facilmente a piedi sia Portobello road sia Kensington Park.

Noise was hit or miss because it’s a ground level unit in a busy nightlife area. Personally I did not like the area. I felt it to be very Grimey. ALOT of nightclubs and homeless people. There were a lot of random weird artsy Knick knacks all over the studio which was fine, for us. My only complaint was the bed sheets, pillows and linens seemed very used. It would help if there was newer ones."

They have details of surrounding area with tips etc. The place is immaculate, very comfortable and in a central location. The only downside is as other people state it’s noisy so if you take your earplugs there’s no issue. Would highly recommend to anyone."

758924,4072552,08/04/2013,4286754,Maria,"Clem and Adam are the best hosts anyone could imagine! 
They confirm the fact that airbnb is more about people, rather than just a place to live. As it was our first airbnb experience, they have set our standard expectations so high that we think it won't be easy to find  again such warm and easy-going hosts. The house is wonderful, recently renovated,warm and very clean as shown in the pictures. We felt like home straight away, and it was hard to leave it when we had to go back to our country. Clem and Adam are very friendly and
generous. They shared everything with us, from juices to even breakfast they were making for themselves. They offer a wide variety of cereals, jams as well as coffee and tea. Everything was amazing.
The neighbourhood is quiet and safe,and has some nice pubs and shops. The public transport system was very convenient for us to use as we had bus stops and overground stations close by.
Clem suggested us some places to visit as well as some beautiful routes we could walk. We can never imagine that we'll stay somewhere else next time we'll visit London. Clem and Adam, we have no words to describe what an amazing time 
we had with you! We wish we could stay more and meet you better..! Thank you for making our trip so special! We will never forget how warm you are!! You deserve everything!! Hope to see you again very soon!

The home accommodated our family of 4 (which includes our 2 daughters - aged 15 and 20) with plenty of room.  The fire place in the living area is a nice touch especially after a long day of site seeing and shopping in the cold weather.   There is also a good sized backyard that can be taken advantage of during nice weather.  We were even able to make arrangements for the cleaner (at an additional charge) to tidy up during our stay.

To summarise, we felt very comfortable in Sara’s “home away from home.”"

Shared with us a lot about his experiences. We couldn't be more grateful for everything that he did to us. He not only gave us a lot informations about London, but also gave us ride to stations, more than one time! He even showed us a beautiful park. It was a absolutely lovely. We definitely recommend.

17521545,362877362,27/12/2018,36650877,Hilarie,"We found the flat to be on a very busy street which was very disappointing. Lots of endless sirens going by every 30 -45 minutes which made it difficult to get a good nights sleep especially for my son who slept on the pull out couch in the living room.  Also, the check in process was a nightmare.  Scrambling on our hands and knees half way down the city block to open a bike lock box seems absurd at any age especially on a dark cold evening after an 11 hour flight.  The flat was pretty and the pictures are accurate but travelers should be forewarned about the negatives noted above."

Flat was very clean, so were the bed sheets and towels. Cleaning and towels/sheets change every week. Kitchen was fully equipped. Veeve were very responsive to our problems: The bed was smaller than we've expected it to be, later to realize UK bed size are smaller than we are used to. Only one set of keys - took Veeve a day to arrange second set. We've experienced cold water at evenings. Veeve support team were not familiar with the boiler at the flat - eventually after a three days with cold showers at evenings which was a TERRIBLE experience in London during February, we realized how to set the timer ourselves and water were great later on. Bottom line, we enjoyed the stay, the amenities, the cleanliness and Veev's service despite the first 3 days upon their issues. We recommend going there."

Couple of things can be improved to help our experience of staying. One is the TV did not work.  This must be a one time event but I wish I was told prior to check in.  The host did try to fix it but not in time.  The WiFi worked but slow.  should and could be easily upgraded."

Lara is an excellent host who was friendly, kind, and welcoming on check-in. The apartment is really cosy, with a beautiful view from the original Georgian sash windows over the square and the church. There is a fast wifi connection, a well-equipped kitchen, and a very comfortable bed.  The location is unbeatable as a base from which to explore London with all the amenities of Islington (shops and excellent restaurants) a stone's throw away, and easy access to tube stations, buses and mainline railway stations.I would definitely stay again if Lara will have me."

The apartment was very clean and had comfortable furniture, and it felt cosy especially with its unique furnishings. There was plenty of space for us to unwind and for our baby to play, within the reception room and conservatory playroom. We appreciated the owners timely communication and tips for exploring Hither Green’s parks and cafes. Hither Green is a hidden gem in itself, it has its village charm and only 10minutes away from London Bridge.

Highly recommend staying here for a true home away from home experience!"

Sally's place is awesome! It was even better than the photos. Very clean and homey and she even had cute little soaps, a toothbrush and razors to use, and milk and cookies in the fridge when we arrived. We also got lucky with the weather so we were able to use her roof top patio every morning for breakfast which was amazing! The neighborhood was so pretty and quiet. The location was fabulous. We walked to portabello road in the morning to get fruit and shop and then walk to the park for a stroll or to the metro to explore other areas of London, and the restaurants by her place were great! Best Indian food a few blocks away! Sally herself was a delight! So sweet and helpful. She even checked in on us halfway through to make sure we were getting along ok! We fell in love with London and with her home and hope to stay with her again soon! Thanks for everything Sally!"

It is very near the Mile's End tube station, which makes getting to the touristy parts of London a breeze. Jennifer herself is a wonderful host, responding quickly to inquiries and very considerate of her guests. Since there is a resident toddler who can be a bit noisy in the mornings (but Jennifer thoughtfully provides earplugs), I heartily recommend this apartment to heavy sleepers eager to see London.

First time here is London. Louw made me feels like I am living in my own place. He is friendly, enjoyable to talk, plus professional to assist you in his place.
He is very considerate, shows that he understand and cares about other people's problems. It is privileged.

Location around his place is safe, also very close to Tesco. If you are looking a place that make you feels like home in London, I am highly recommend to pick this room. You will never regrets.

By the way, this place is just too fancy, I am worry if I can never find such a good place with a reasonable price. This is so valuable and nice experience to me and my girlfriend.

The stay went very well, the apartment is clean, calm and well located in London (Brick Lane district) to move by foot, bus or subway. It is a ten-minute walk from Liverpool Street station. Athena offered us a different breakfast every day. She lent us two Oyster cards, which was nice of her. For Francophones who do not speak very good English, Athena is bilingual which can help you. The neighborhood allows you to try out different culinary cultures, and it is quiet. I highly recommend this accommodation if you want to visit London. Thank you Athena and Christiano

J'ai passé presque une semaine en voyage à Londres avec mon frère dans l'appartement d'Athena. Le séjour s'est très bien passé, l'appartement est propre, calme et bien situé dans Londres (Quartier Brick Lane) pour se déplacer à pied, en bus ou en métro. Il est à dix minutes à pied de la gare Liverpool Street. Athena nous a proposé un petit déjeuner différent chaque jour. Elle nous a prêté deux cartes Oyster ce qui était gentil de sa part. Pour les francophones qui ne parle pas très bien anglais, Athena est bilingue ce qui peut vous aider. Le quartier vous permet de tester différentes cultures culinaires, et il est tranquille.

There's a supermarket nearby... To make a long story short, it has everything you need and is in the centre of London.

But definitely the best part are the hosts Carol and Alana. They are amazing: always ready to give advice/chat and are the friendliest, most open people you'll ever meet.

21970486,547976774,16/10/2019,5362566,Kevin,"The initial communication with the team was fantastic. We coordinated for an early arrival (12pm on Saturday) and my wife and I made sure we were there. After waiting about 10 minutes, I contacted the number provided and was surprised to hear that my check-in was supposed to be 12pm on Sunday. The person assigned for check-in that day was too far away and said someone else would be able to come but it would take some time. We had all of our luggage and the only place we could sit at was Founder's Arms. We waited, had lunch and received a call around 1:15pm. 

The gentleman was cordial and let us in the unit. He admitted it was his first time in the unit but we appreciated him helping out. Upon entering the unit, we saw some dust and crumbs on the table and counter and also saw milk in the fridge. All of this didn't bother me too much and I wanted to get it cleaned myself as we had reservations and plans for the day . It was when my wife entered the bedroom and looked at the bed that we were shocked. It was obviously made but had stains on the comforter, pillow and sheets and had long hair all around. The gentleman was speechless. He found some sheets and bedding and was going to change it himself. Unfortunately, we found more hair, dust, and general uncleanliness in the bedroom and bathroom. It was then that we asked for a re-clean. After some time, he said a cleaner should be there in about 1hr per his main office. He said he would call with a confirmation so we can make sure our schedule is kept while we were visiting London.

Around 3pm, now about 1.5hrs after we left the unit, we called the main office as the gentleman did not answer my texts/calls. He later said he was looking to get answers before responding. The main office, however, stated that cleaning had been scheduled and he confirmed that the cleaning person arrived around 3pm. We thought it would take 60 - 75 min for the cleaning so we got back to the unit around 4/4:15pm. The gentleman from prior was standing outside the unit and said the cleaning person has yet to arrive. This was after the main office told us the cleaning had already begun! Around 4:30,pm the cleaning person arrived and began cleaning. She completed all work around 6:30pm. 

First impressions are everything and they took away 6.5 hours of our day and continued to misguide (whether intentionally or because they were misinformed themselves). No one contacted us and never tried to make things better. Worse, Airbnb only offered us 1/2 the cleaning cost ($47) as a way to make things better. 

Based on my experience, I hope this company does better on coordination and communication."
5723059,168694815,10/07/2017,75199255,Yasushi,"Fiona and Paul are the best hosts ever.  Their hospitality is genuine and made feel completely at home.  Moreover, the advice given by Paul on the local pubs is very accurate and we enjoyed all of them very much.
The location of the house is very convenient.  Only 10-15 minutes' walk to 3 tube stations and bus stops.  Bus 94 takes us to Picadilly Circus through very attractive route.  We rode on the bus a number of times.
We will definitely stay with them again next time."

Only after making some calls she was able to help. 
Overall a great stay and place - and surely easy to find with the right location details provided. "

The upperfloor is under decoration and a little noisy some night; and the police even knocked at the door at 6am to check the upperfloor people for left a lot garbage in the front door.

We were quite disappointed with the room as the picture in the announce does not correspond with the real life. In fact there are other two rooms that were booked and ours was super small. The beds are very inconfortables and the bathroom was also shared with other 4 people (again not mentioned in the description, that only says a ""private bathroom for our guests """

28605889,493912378,23/07/2019,148416006,Olivia,"On arrival to the apartment I was slightly uncomfortable as there was a bad smell clearly covered up by plug in air freshener.
The house is extremely old and dirty. The carpets are stained and there is dust and grime everywhere. 
Having been in the apartment an hour or so I began to run the bath for my 6 month old baby... I noticed 2 black dots in the bath that began to jump as the water reached them. I managed to catch one of them only to see that they were fleas. Feeling absolutely disgusted and sick to my stomach I squashed the flea and washed it down the sink. I was now worried that they would be elsewhere and that my children would be bitten. I checked the beds and they were also infested. 
Taking photos of fleas isn’t an easy task and you have taken advantage of the situation nd of my good nature. 
I called you immediately and we agreed fully on my reimbursement and you also thanked me for offering to pay two night plus a cleaning fee. An offer that no longer stands since you’ve lied and deceived me into thinking you were a decent human being. 
You also admitted that there was an infestation and that you would be fumigating the flat which would also have meant that we would have had to leave the premises in order for you to do so. Having 3 small children in a fumigated apartment is simply not an option. 
You then went on to tell me that there is a cat problem at the back of the house which is where the bathroom window is and that the previous guests had left the window open and let a cat in, obviously where the fleas came from originally. 
We agreed that you would pay in cash into my Gibraltar account and then you went quiet. I heard nothing. No response to my many calls or messages. A totally cowardly, lazy and disgusting way to behave after how I had treated you with such respect and kindness in such a revolting situation. 
You have now declined me reimbursement and so I will proceed to report this to whoever I need to in order to get my very hard earned money back."

Great sized room, great house with a nice kitchen with lots of natural light including a backyard with a tree (seems to be a rarity in London). The location was brilliant with a 24hr bus stop across the road which takes you either straight into London centre or to Hackney Central overground which can easily get you to Camden or other places of interest. The house mates were also lovely and made us feel very welcomed into their home. Thank you!"
35195514,466454393,09/06/2019,101848777,Richard,"Generally the flat was as described, small and light and fine for a short stay for one person. It gets lots of sunlight and is a convenient location for Hampstead and West Hampstead, the latter which has good transport links to other parts of London and beyond. As stated it is a mezzanine so not a separate bedroom rather a separate bed area. In my opinion the bed was low quality given the price of the rental, as it was a mattress on the floor that was not very firm, fine for a couple of nights but compares poorly to beds in similarly priced hotels in London in my experience. Also note it is not possible to stand fully upright in the bed area due to the mezzanine arrangement."

This was our first visit to London and so we truly appreciated Gary's helpfulness and suggestions.  Booking was easy and Gary responded quickly to my queries.
This very modern apartment is nicer than the photos show and is kept spotlessly clean. The bedroom is easily large enough with plenty of robe and drawer space. The bed is really comfortable- my husband and I both have back problems but none during our stay. The central heating was perfect for the time of year, the TV in our room was easy to operate, the bathroom is just across the hall from the bedroom and is also heated (and spotless). 
The location is good- we walked to Trafalgar Square the day we arrived and to trains, buses, the river boat, The London Eye, Westminster, and much more. 
Our time in London was a great experience, a major part of this is due to our lovely host.  Thank you Gary. "

I was astonished at its central location and the fact it was only a 7 to 10 minute walk to shopping paradise on Oxford St.There are so many quaint restaurants and bars in the vicinity and you are just a three minute walk to Picadilly.......but the best part was indeed Christine.The second I arrived in her eclectic and special flat I felt a peace come over me.I wasn't feeling well and Christine took such good care of me offering to make special teas etc.She gives you the privacy you need but also opens up her flat as if you were family. I can't wait to go back and stay with Christine and hopefully it will be for a much longer stay. Enjoy this gem of an abode away from home as much as I did."

14409704,321875301,11/09/2018,11052088,Sara,We were a bit disappointed with Manu’s place. The room was very small (so small that there was really no place to open up our carry-on sized luggage). We probably would have been ok with it but then the “breakfast” was literally just some random teabags and instant coffee and a box of crackers. Together these things made us a little sad. On a positive note while we never meet Manu in person she was very quick with communication and her friends who were staying there were lovely. As others have mentioned there was also an awesome cat and the general areas of the apartment were beautiful.

Politely requested a refund which was refused, and was told by the host in so many words if I hadn't been stingy and paid a whole extra £20 I would have been insured for covid related cancellations.

You'd think they could overlook this oversight given the circumstances we're all in, but clearly turning a profit is more important than decency and good customer service to this host.

Bianca was extremely condescending and quite unhelpful

So all in all they've made £120 for doing sweet FA.

Will be more careful in future and always read every option when it comes to cancellation and insurance policies."

Place is very basic but has what you need if your staying for a short amount of time. However it was difficult to get to sleep as there was a lot of noise outside, lucky I am a heavy sleeper!

It was a good set up for a small family (I traveled with my husband and 1 1/2 year old), we had plenty of room and felt my toddler was able to get around the place easily.  The pictures were very accurate!  We took a bottle of the wine back with us from Sam's family's vineyard, can't wait to try it!"

The flat is very comfy, full kitchen, bathroom, appliances, room is small but comfortable bed...the neighborhood is nice and greenish, with some restaurants and shops.

26154662,408721462,05/02/2019,16211461,Cynthia,Charlotte is a wonderful host with spot on communication and has a spectacular home that deserves a spot in Architect Digest. Very close to everything that is live and near the best markets in Camden. We were looking for a real local experience and this was it. We also appreciate the local tips provided by our host and love the fresh daffodils in vases left around the home upon our arrival as well. Thank you Charlotte for hosting us.

325673,34173833,05/06/2015,33294789,Derek,"Nice place and convenient location!

Your host, Alon, is very accommodating and extremely responsive. He will make sure your stay is comfortable and he will do what he can to accommodate you, if possible.
The place is nice and clean with lots of interesting artwork (most of which was created by his mother - they were very impressive). My sister and I only stayed for a night, so we didnt use the shower much. The place is spacious and had a lot of natural lighting.

The place is very convenient, with shops, places to eat, markets, and the metro to downtown London very nearby.

Overall, we enjoyed our stay at Alon's place!"
9223283,100608571,10/09/2016,17297,Joelle,"Carrie-Anne's place was perfect for me. I was arriving late and staying just one night. It was very easy to find from Heathrow--and I don't know London--and Carrie-Anne was super communicative and welcoming, even though I had troubles with my flight and arrived late. The place was very clean, very comfortable. A good little spot. "

Es la descripción más precisa que puedo hacer. Justine es muy agradable y atenta, el lugar es limpio, la cama muy cómoda. Estás a 50 metros de una parada de bus. Sientes que recibes más de lo que pagas, definitivamente recomendable."
1128785,322209775,12/09/2018,30257113,Ha,Patricia was a lovely host and very helpful. Her home was really comfortable to stay in and we had a really nice chat as well. She even offered to do my laundry which is rare of Airbnb hosts. Overall a great stay and I would recommend Patricia's place.
12004105,130223889,05/02/2017,39027980,Josh,"Fantastic place, the pictures don't do it justice with just how comfortable our stay was. The location of the studio is fantastic, an easy walk to the tube station and you can find yourself in Victoria station within 30 minutes. Such a warm welcome and one which I will definitely be turning back to when heading back to London."
6606418,41098623,04/08/2015,36463438,Alex,Gorgeous apartment. Clean from top to bottom. Anja was a great host and provided tonnes of useful information when we arrived. Perfectly situated just outside of the city centre with great transport links. The apartment itself was very modern and had its own quirks. A thoroughly enjoyable experience staying here with my partner :) 
46167280,717101747,21/12/2020,117415854,Simon,"We stayed at Ted's place while house-hunting in London and found it to be a great option, a short walk to the tube station, cafes, and Hyde Park. It has all the basic amenities you would need for a short stay, though when we arrived the oven had not been fully equipped. Ted was very quick to reply when we needed any assistance, and was happy to help when we asked to extend our stay at short notice. Although the mattress could be better we slept well each night as the apartment is very quiet despite the central location."
34663126,572620175,03/12/2019,190076156,Sarah,"Convenient location, but I had numerous problems, so probably wouldn’t stay here again. When I arrived, the sheets were stained. I mentioned it to reception, and the sheets were replaced but with another set that were also stained. The locker took multiple tries to get open/closed due to wear, and the bunk did not even have a light/power, as it seems you needed to talk to reception for that - not something I wanted to do after climbing into that tiny little bunk."
23353889,324633417,17/09/2018,31252282,Eng,"Robert’s place is in a great location - close to everything.  The apartment is very nicely done and modern.  Bed was very comfortable.  Some amenities need to be added for a more comfortable stay - hooks for towels, extra towels and soap for our three night stay would’ve been nice.  Communication is nearly non existent in terms of how to get into the apartment.  Our contact person is Zac who is not the most responsive person.  Started to feel nervous about how to get into apartment.  Then I forgot receipts at apartment after  I was leaving for airport and after many weeks, multiple texts and many long distance calls to Zac asking him to mail to me and I would pay for his time and expense, I’ve finally given up.   Service is not part of the stay."
250995,156983502,02/06/2017,15368594,Cassandra,"This is a nice compact flat, but actually smaller than it appears in the photos. Suitable for travellers on a limited budget, a little worn out and tired. On the 4th/ top floor, quite noisy. Hosts very communicative and friendly."
9751730,66230786,20/03/2016,5186542,Antonio,"Alex is a fantastic host. She is super cool and friendly, flexible to our needs and easy to meet and to communicate with.

The flat is perfect both if you are working in the area and need a comfy place easy to reach and if you are on holiday and want to use it as a starting point to visit London.

Super close to Brick Lane and its lively atmosphere and very well connected with tube and buses. Short distance to Shoreditch and Liverpool Street.

The room is big and tidy, nicely furnished and the bed is very comfortable. The whole flat is very clean and cosy, Alex made sure we could feel at home.

The breakfast was included (had a very nice Italian espresso in a moka coffee machine!) and all in all the stay was very good value for money!

I will definitely come back and would recommend A&M's flat to any traveller! "

5555679,98344747,30/08/2016,51334180,Carrie,"Thanks so much to Kim and Trish for being such wonderful hosts. Their flat is lovely and they have thought of every detail. Our 8 yr old twin boys wanted to spend more time in their place than touring London! 

The flat is impeccably and extensively furnished. It's hard to think of what Kim and Trish havent thought of. The kitchen has every appliance imaginable from coffee machine to toaster and is very well stocked with dishes and food. Kim even purchased basic groceries for us before arrival, making our first day easy and relaxing. The bedrooms are comfortable and well appointed, with plenty of closet and drawer space. The wet room is luxurious, having been finished in a stunning rusted tin tile inlay arrangement. 

Kim provided us with extensive and expert tour advice and brochures making our stay even easier. He went way above and beyond by providing a gym membership after we inquired about the location of the nearest gym. 

It would be impossible to replicate the array of amenities and services at 45 Finborough at a hotel, no matter the cost. 

We'll be back one day soon and would love to stay with Kim and Trish again. "

Really enjoyed the stay. Closer from Balham tube station than I expected, was immaculately clean and the owners were very accommodating. 
The bed was very comfy, which is important to me due to having back issues. Nice little touches like tea and coffee being available and even eggs and croissants left for us."

Her house is lovely, comfortable and well kept. Even if it looks far from the city center it is not, thanks to the overground which is only 3 min away and takes you to Liverpool Street station in 10 min.
Vicki herself is really nice, helpful and always available to help you get around and have a nice conversation while managing to give you the privacy you need. Plus she will provide you with detailed information to find and access the house should you arrive in the middle of the night like we did.
I highly recommend and try to book again next time I visit London :)"

The house is laid out so well , you can see that alot of thought has gone into the design of the house. The house is ART, and you got heated floors in the bathroom #winning.

772573,4802993,27/05/2013,5456259,Karen,"Amelia's flat is small.  But if you're prepared for that, you're find it great.  We flew to London via LA from New Zealand, so very tired when we arrived.  Amelia had a friend waiting for us at the flat with keys and instructions etc.  The flat was very easy to find.  We did not need to contact her or her other contacts she had left for us as her instructions re the flat were great.  Brixton is not the best part of London, but very central and you're in the West End or City in half hour on bus.  Quicker on tube, but the bus system is great in London and you get to see where you're going. Would stay again"

It is located within a large private Estate on the riverside, and has a concierge which makes checking in really  convenient.  The apartment has absolutely everything and Elise added some very thoughtful details for us to make us feel even more welcome.

To get into the centre of Westmister from the flat takes time regardless of the form of transport and it is advisable to check connections before heading out. We quite liked the option of taking the train to Clapham Junction and going to Waterloo from there."

He greeted me with a smile and details about the apartment -- I knew everything I needed to in order to make my brief stay a good one.  

The location is fantastic -- right next to Chelsea FC's stadium, a 10 minute walk to Kings Road and a train or bus ride away to most of London's wonderful neighborhoods. Hagen provided all these details and ensured that I'd be on my way toward a host of dinner and shopping options with no concerns.

All together, Hagen's the kind of host that makes Airbnb such a special community. I'd stay here again in a heartbeat!"

The room was exactly as described, spacious and clean with lots of storage space for your clothes. Ensuite bathroom was essential, small by North American standards (like anywhere in London), but shower water pressure was super. Bed was soft and cozy and large. Kitchen had all facilities. Rooftop view was a bonus. Location is perfect, on top Old St. tube with access to tourist points sout (i.e. Tower of London), the east (Brick Lane, Hoxton), and west (touristy London). Amazing value and experience. 10/10"
90700,57814551,29/12/2015,50769532,Noorin,"This was our first experience in renting an apartment through Airbnb. Chil’s immediate responses throughout the booking process and that continued until the day we arrived in London on late evening eve of Christmas impressed us. The apartment is exactly as described and shown:- clean and neat, 1 min walk to Notting Hill Gate metro station. Tesco, M&S and everything we need was within 5 - 10 mins walk. Plus point that it is located near the famous Portobello district, lending lively and safe atmosphere. The kitchen is equipped with almost all utensils and crockeries. Chil had prepared the necessity like cereal, milk, floor, oil etc. A saviour as all shops and transportations were closed on Christmas Day. We are thankful for her kind gesture.
We spent our daily morning coffee at the beautiful patio while watching the dark winter sky cleared up. It was a nice addition to the memorable stay.
The only downside is the small bedroom. The room is without closet or space to fit our clothes except for the 3 drawers. With limited storage space, we left most of our clothes in the suitcases in the  living room. The angle of the bed is quite awkward that the one sleeping nearer to the wall has to crawl in or out from the side of bed when the other is sleeping. However, Chil made up for it all with her thoughtfulness. We would certainly stay in the apartment again in future. Thank you.

Generally, the landlord doesn't allow us to bring a dog in, but Ron is very good, which makes us have a good memory in Victoria. The house is a very warm two bedroom, functional area and non functional area are isolated, well equipped with facilities,the traffic around the house is very convenient, life is also very convenient, it is only 3-5 minutes walk to Buckingham Palace and green park. I highly recommend Ron's house."

They're really laid-back, made me feel totally welcome, and helped me book a taxi when I had to change my flight at the last minute. The flat is in a great location, extremely convenient for anyone exploring East London. The room itself is quite cozy and private, and the mattress was really good on my back. The location is quiet. I'm really grateful to Ben and Chavala's hospitality, and would totally book this room again. "

From the moment we stepped out of our car ride, they were there to greet us, even though we hadn't told them we were there yet.  Check-in was flawless, and easy.  They took the time to get us settled in, explain everything, make recommendations, etc.  The apartment was fantastic!  You would be hard-pressed to find a better location, or hosts.  The kitchen and bathroom were fully stocked, above and beyond, with everything you would want and require.  Likewise, the bedrooms were clean and well stocked with clean towels and fresh linens.  The shower had exceptional water pressure from a rain-shower fixture, which was wonderful after a long day.  I was here on business, but with my family, so I can say that this is a perfect apartment for business or holiday travelers.  Close to everything, just steps from great restaurants, pubs, nightlife, and even the Hippodrome (casino)!  Excellent stay, would absolutely, without hesitation, stay here again, and recommend it with the highest accolades. Thanks again fellas!"

We visited London for the first time and Dieneke was very helpful with all information and advices on how to get around and what to visit.

The room is cosy, there is a kitchen, and a shared bathroom with two other rooms. It was clean and tidy! The flat has a good location, 10 minutes walk from Camden Town, otherwise you can take the bus which is just in front of the door (number 29). We didn't meet Viviane but she was really nice to us as we forgot to pack our luggages before the next guests arrive, so she closed and putted it in the corridor :) 
Thank you again, we will come back here for our next trip to London ! "

TJ was there to welcome us, the communication was perfect both before and during our stay. We were made to feel more than at home with her and her lovely family.
TJ also helped with her local knowledge (which was invaluable) as we had very few plans for our second day in London but she gave us some great ideas which we thoroughly enjoyed, thanks again TJ, we'll definitely be back :-)"

We chose it mainly based on the competitive price and the positive reviews and also because it was a reasonable distance to the theatre (30-40 minutes in total - 15 min walk to tube then 15/20 mins to Leicester Square). It was everything that we hoped for: our hosts were welcoming and our room was very comfortable, and while it is not the most central of properties, we are not adverse to a bit of walking, and this meant that it was a quiet retreat from the hustle and bustle of central London! The house itself is very homely, and we particularly enjoyed the impressive collection of comics and related literature on the bookshelf in our room! A light breakfast of cereals, toast and yoghurt was provided for us, which was a nice touch, and we had our own shelf in the fridge. We hope you enjoy staying here as much as we did!"

The apartment is badly isolated and you can hear everything, especially when one of our (Hidden by Airbnb) slammed the front door shut and the noises that came from the street. Apart from that we’ve enjoyed our stay. The apartment is very central next to the Holborn metro station and a 15-minute walk to Covent Garden."

The flat is just as pictured and actually a bit bigger than I thought that it would. The host was so helpful in helping to organize pre-check in storage of luggage (though we ended up not needing it) and all the useful tips about local restaurants and businesses. I have stayed in several places in London and this flat is my favorite place. 

One note for anyone who is interested in renting this property, it is in a urban setting. There are several restaurants nearby and the normal noises that come with that. My friend and I had no issues with it because it provided the same background as our hometowns. However I think that it might be uncomfortable for someone not used to it."

I have never forgotten the warmth and the hospitality she showed me during my time in London. The room is very cozy and  lovely. I felt at home when I first entered in.It was my very first time to be in London and Eli was also the very first person who reliefed my homesickness while my stay in her house. She likes my second mum who cares me and guides me  through all the difficult times I have been had there.  I can see she did try her very best to help every single guest to feel comfortable and relax during stay.  It was very convenient to go to the supermarket which only take about few minutes walking distance. The surroundings around the house is very quite and clean. There is a very big and nice  park near to the house , if you like jogging and excrise, it will only take you less than 3 minutes to reach there. Eli was always there for us  if we have any questions.  And meanwhile, you will definitely enjoy being together  with her ,her families and friends ,they are all very nice and kind people. If you want to have a nice trip in London, Eli's house will be your best choice!
对于一个从来没有去过英国的我来讲,第一次因公出来学习｡面对父母的担心和牵挂,面对自己将要在英国度过未知的七周,心里的那份忐忑和不安是那些常人所不能理解的｡当我第一次见到Eli 的时候,深深地被她那和蔼可亲的笑容感染了｡她很热心的帮我把行李送到房间,耐心指点我所有需要知道的问题,让我在陌生的国度找到一丝安慰｡她就像妈妈一样关心我的生活,每当我遇到困难时她总是尽力帮我找到解决的办法,我们之间无形中建立了一种默契｡
房间很干净,温馨｡光线非常好,房间里的构造和格局总体来讲我都很喜欢｡每周的阿姨都会过来打扫房间,Eli也会经常自己收拾｡厨房里所有的东西都可以用,Eli 考虑的很周到,为了那些短期房客便于携带行李,她准备了一些基本的日常用品在洗手间(沐浴液,洗发膏,洗脸霜和牙膏),可以说是一应俱全｡
交通也极为方便,无论是去超市买东西购物或是去公园散步锻炼,都非常方便,仅用不到五分钟的时间就可以到达目的地｡离巴士站和Train station 都很靠近,仅用几分钟的时间,而且附近还有好吃的中国餐厅,离医院也非常近,不到三分钟的路程,住在Eli 的家,无论对于出差工作或者个人旅行都会是一个很不错的选择｡强烈推荐"
11571554,547466167,15/10/2019,21732972,Mark,"This is a great location but with that comes some downsides. If you need peace & quiet than this is not the place for you. You will hear activity at all hours of the day so bring earplugs. Again, the location is great as you are in the center of everything! Another strange thing for my group was the toilet. It felt like an outhouse style with the wooden seat. I mean it’s a normal toilet but the wooden seat was a little off putting"

If you're a light sleeper, likely to be an issue due to noise from planes overhead."
529558,41248408,05/08/2015,3938678,Niel,"The location could not be better - 2m walking distance from King's X, only a 30min walk to the West End and so quiet... There are not many places in London where you can sleep with the curtains open without anyone being able to look in

A practical, nicely equipped flat - a bit of a squeeze for 6/7, but fine for 4/5 people.

Brigitte was super friendly and helpful, leaving us a nice little welcoming gift in the fridge!"
27828670,537803954,29/09/2019,142635404,Debra,"This place is exactly as described in the listing. We had 2 sleep pods and they were really clean and comfortable. The room smelt of lavender which was so relaxing. There was, apparently, someone else in the third pod, but we didn’t see or hear them at all. The pods were in an office block and my only slight reservation was that to go to the loo, you needed to come out of the pod room, through 2 locked doors, into the office corridor and up some stairs. This is a bit disconcerting in the middle of the night in pajamas! I don’t think I would stay there as a woman on my own, but that’s my preference and absolutely no reflection on the place. I have just included it on here in case it helps inform any travellers. 
With my husband, we found it good value and I slept like a log."

Thursday's noise levels were absolutely mental. I may aswell have gone clubbing because I felt every beat, heard every song and multiple conversations.... The madness didnt stop till around 4am... Never experienced anything like it. London lives to party!!! I can only imagine what it will be like tonight. That said, I still like the flat and my neighbours seemed to be very pleasant people.  I would certainly consider staying again Mon-Weds only if I need to be dead central. Decent value for money. I never met Bianca but her colleagues were nice and helpful."

Our room was very pretty and clean and it has a wonderful view of the city of London. Diana gave us a lot of suggestions what to do. One of them was the comedy club ""The Bill Murrey"" where we spent a lot of time. It's just a 10 min walk from Dianas place so if you like free comedy we can highly recommend it!

We felt that to get two bedrooms, a private bathroom, a shared bathroom (our host shared it) and a little kitchenette in such a prime location for what we paid was a great deal."

Tube stations within a short walking distance. It’s a lively part of town with lots of bars and restaurants on the doorstep. If your looking for a quiet neighborhood it’s not the place for you.  If you want to be in the heart of the city it’s a great location. The apartment is up a few stairs but nothing unmanageable. It has a full kitchen with all the utensils you need.

We were provided coffee and Mary made sure that we got all the details and tips we need for our stay in London. No need to say that at the time we arrived the room was not ready yet. Mary went the extra mile by sending us a text message when the room was ready and offered us to stay as long as we wish the next morning.

She is a very kind, considerate person and very accessible and easy to communicate with when you need her - and helpful in any way you could wish. 

I only talked a few times briefly with her roommate Barri, but he seems very nice and easy going, her roommate Michele and his girlfriend were very nice, welcoming and sociable. 
Bianca's room is lovely and exactly as described. The common areas are as you would expect in a shared house.
In total, I highly recommend Bianca's place."

La habitación tiene detalles que hacen la diferencia respecto a otros sitios, café con agua caliente en la habitación (gracias por los chocolates, por cierto), la habitación climatizada. La ubicación súper céntrica, pasan varias rutas a unos cuantos pasos que te llevan a cualquier parte, pero incluso moverte en Uber no es caro porque está muy cerca todo. En nuestro caso fuimos a Liverpool de rápido, muy cerca de la estación que Euston que es la que conecta con el tren que va hacia allá. Nuestro vuelo iba a llegar muy tarde y todavía se retrasó, Gary y Shaz nos esperaron, muchas gracias por eso. Excelente evaluación calidad/precio/ubicación. Lo recomiendo ampliamente."

No entanto a limpeza do ambiente no geral precisaria ser melhorada. Eu  não esperava um hotel três estrelas e o anúncio deixa claro que limpeza não é a prioridade, porém diria que as áreas comuns (corredor, cozinha) beiravam o insalubre. O quarto estava menos pior,  mas ainda assim tive que matar uma aranha na chegada. Só varrer ou aspirar uma vez por semana, colocar a louça na lava louças faria maravilhas. O apartamento é grande, é bonito, é bem localizado, é barato. Mas considero importante que os próximos hóspedes saibam da questão da limpeza, caso forem sensíveis a isso."

On top of all my flight was late but she was waiting and I can have only the best words for her hospitality. Terry's place is (10-15) minute walking from tube station and I would call it very good connected. Room is cozy, very well equipped, almost as small studio. I was using it mostly for sleep over and early morning work since I spent most of my time out. I would say general impression is very good, according to expectations in that price range. I spent only two nights there and didn't have enough time to explore the neighbourhood but I guess there are lot of interesting places to see. Also I want to say internet connection was very good, and I had no problems completing my tasks from the room. There is a desk big enough for laptop and some papers so if you need to spend few hours working you will have no problems at all."

Living room was bright, bed was comfortable and kitchen was well equipped. 10min walk from tube stations so it’s well connected. Area was safe and residential. There seemed to be some nice local spots for food but we went further afield due to our plans. Good base for west London. Check-in was easy and Dawn kindly allowed us a late checkout."

12154723,112993391,09/11/2016,45386751,Susan,Rodrigo was a most wonderful spontaneous and flexible host who offered his beautiful home for arrival within 1 1/2 hour in the evening after an other host cancelled our stay. The apartment is just as beautiful as on the picture. We came for a trade fair at Excel and loved taking the scenic convenient cable car across. For taxi and Uber driver you need to remember the name and address of the Pub across the road since the development is very new. Would definitely stay with Rodrigo again. Many thanks for all your hospitality.

Thy e property was a dream, so perfect enough space, air, light, flowers and beauty. She is super friendly and helpful as well. We ended up having dinner with her, cooking for her because she made such amazing breakfasts for us and chats because she has travelled all over the world. The just moved from Malta! The best Russian beetroot soups also to be found here. Delicious home made jam, butter and bread found here. And some cute ass cats and a crazy ginger cat that appears once in a while.

529070,125894718,08/01/2017,99715876,Miyuki,"1月に8日間ここでお世話になりました｡最寄り駅はJubilee lineのswiss cottage駅､Northern lineのbelsize park駅でそれぞれ10分ほど歩きます｡似たような家が続いており少しわかりにくいです｡夜は人通りも少ないですが､この地域はわりと高級なので治安は大丈夫です｡ﾛﾝﾄﾞﾝを一望できるprimrose hillや､the beatlesのabbey roadなどは15分ほどの徒歩圏内です｡またcamden townも30分ほどで歩いていけます｡街中に出るとなると､電車でも30分はかかります｡
洗面系だと､ﾕﾆｯﾄﾊﾞｽですがかなり清潔なｼｬﾜｰとﾄｲﾚでした｡ｼｬﾜｰしかありませんのでお風呂にはつかれません｡しかしお湯や水圧は良かったです｡ﾀｵﾙの替え､ｼｬﾝﾌﾟｰ･ﾘﾝｽ･ﾎﾞﾃﾞｨｰｿｰﾌﾟ等(誰かの使いかけですが)､また歯ﾌﾞﾗｼ歯磨き粉などｱﾒﾆﾃｨは十分でした｡ﾋｰﾀｰがあったのでお風呂場も暖かかったです｡ 8日の間に床が掃除された形跡はありませんでした｡
寝室には2人で寝ても余るほど大きなﾍﾞｯﾄﾞと､小さな机､ｸﾛｰｾﾞｯﾄ(ﾊﾝｶﾞｰ掛けしかできません)がありました｡寝室に鏡がなかったので私は廊下の姿見でｺﾃを使ったりしました｡(ﾛﾝﾄﾞﾝは洗面台にｺﾝｾﾝﾄがありません)
ｷｯﾁﾝは4口ｶﾞｽｺﾝﾛで調理器具は揃っていました｡塩胡椒ｵﾘｰﾌﾞｵｲﾙや醤油､少しの調味料はありました｡またｲﾝｽﾀﾝﾄｺｰﾋｰや紅茶も用意されていました｡
ﾀﾞｲﾆﾝｸﾞはとても広々としていて､のんびりくつろげました｡
1階にﾎｽﾄが住んでおり､2階に上がって鍵のかかってあるﾄﾞｱを開けると寝室､ｼｬﾜｰ､ﾀﾞｲﾆﾝｸﾞﾙｰﾑ､ｷｯﾁﾝがあります｡しかし日中は2階の寝室の隣の部屋をﾎｽﾄが仕事で使用します｡最初に何時にいるのか聞くと､10:30〜19:00ごろ仕事部屋を使用すると話していましたが､朝11時ごろでもまだ来ませんでした｡私たちが家を出るまで待っていてくれたのかも知れません｡1度20:00ごろ帰宅した際まだ仕事部屋にいらっしゃったこともありましたが､挨拶をする程度でした｡
気を使わず丸一日家でゆっくりしたい方は少し難しいかもしれません｡
ﾎｽﾄのｸﾘｽとﾚﾅｰﾀはとても感じが良く､私たちは英語がｽﾗｽﾗと喋れるわけではありませんが､特に困ったことはありませんでした｡また周辺の地図や､洋書ばかりですがﾛﾝﾄﾞﾝのｶﾞｲﾄﾞﾌﾞｯｸが置いてあったり､お花やﾌﾙｰﾂ､年越しの際にはﾜｲﾝをﾌﾟﾚｾﾞﾝﾄして下さったりとﾎｽﾋﾟﾀﾘﾃｨ溢れる方たちでした｡"

The location is fantastic for anyone who wants to spend time in London's eastern parts. The canal walk literally outside the door is beautiful. 
The room is very comfortable, although it looks a bit bigger in the images than it actually feels. We also appreciated that there is a walk-in-closet where guests can hang their clothes.

22041018,276615230,14/06/2018,6632404,Brittany And Dylan,"This was our first time visiting London and by luck we happened to stumble across Cosmin and Robert's place on airbnb. It was absolutely amazing and made our trip to London that much better! We were there for almost a week and it was in a perfect spot for us as we wanted to have someplace away from the craziness of the city but still in a place that was easy to get to all the attractions. Being located between two tube stations (Earl's Court and Glouster Rd) made everything perfect, plus if you don't mind biking it was pretty easy to bike to as well. The little added touches like the welcome note with loads of suggestions that we used and the coffee options were just icing on the cake and Robert and Cosmin were just the nicest hosts. They are also able to shut the door to there private area so you don't feel like you are intruding on them! Their pup Consi was so adorable and friendly greeting us right away but was so quiet the whole time. Overall loved our time there! Big thank you to Robert, Cosmin and Consi for letting us stay at their home."

One of my favorite features of the room is the outside garden. Wonderful light comes in the room because of the garden doors, and it's a great place to sit outside and enjoy a  beverage at the end of the workday. I enjoyed sitting in the garden this trip and enjoy the autumn. Looking forward to the next visit."

The apartment is two level, very clean, and the bedroom is spacious. Guy was very generous with his time and offered a nice breakfast. 

The area is very quiet but you can still easily get around London. Perhaps the only detractor is that there is no shower in the apartment, only a bath. But this is just a matter of personal preference. 

Overall, very nice stay."
19688000,198682462,30/09/2017,39484922,Peter,"The apartment is in a great location with easy access to central London via the tube, clipper or bus. The 02 arena is an easy ten minute walk and has a wide range of restaurants and bars. There is a Tesco Express where you can get most of the basics including food, wine and beer. 
The apartment has great unrestricted views of the Thames and is a great place to relax at the end of a long day exploring London.
Stephen and his team are very responsive if you should need to call on them and Natalie who greeted us was very pleasant to deal with and helpful providing advice about getting the most out of your London stay. 
I have no hesitation in recommending this apartment and Steven and his team."

The apartment is centered in a really nice living area and very close to Sainsburys and the tube station. That way it was really easy and convenient to go to the city center. Paul always responded very quickly and he and his partner were really kind and helpful. The flat offered everything we needed and we thought it was really sweet we got some candy as a welcoming.

Was surprised by the proximity to the tube station, it was literally a stone's throw away! We were also greeted with a very cosy interior and the host was really kind to provide milk eggs and cereal for breakfast. I must say that the interior was really well put together and i appreciate that as a designer. My wife used the modern kitchen facilities to cook meals for us. It was close to really good bakeries, dining joints and a couple of parks were walking distances away. Overall i had a great experience and if im coming back to london ill stay here again. Thank you.

Jen and Matt have thought of everything in this beautiful and spacious property. With fresh juice, bagels and organic jams provided, we wanted for nothing. It is absolutely perfect and was a highlight of our month around Europe - it felt so luxurious for such a reasonable price. Initially I was a little apprehensive of it's location, but Jen put my mind at rest. The suburb of Queens Park is a gorgeous community with supermarkets, cafes and gastro pubs on main roads bordering both sides of the street where the home is located - we loved the Whippet Inn in Kensal Rise and The Alice in Salusbury Road - both only  5 minutes walk away. You can also catch the bus to Notting Hill - once again only a 5 min walk to the bus stop with buses coming all the time and a 10 min trip by bus to Notting Hill, Kensingston etc. The tube station is only 5 minutes walk and is on the Bakerloo line which is the same line for Oxford Circus and Piccadilly circus (maybe 8 stops?). As a family of 5, we had options of squeezing ourselves into small flats with sofa beds in more ""known"" locations around London (for more $$$!!!) but there wasn't a moment that we didn't congratulate ourselves on choosing to go just a smidge further out and have a incredible experience that our whole family loved and appreciated. With such excellent and easy transport options and such a divine property with the most amazing, friendly and super helpful hosts, you simply should choose this property! BTW, I'm a travel writer so am very discerning and don't often use these sort of accolades. But every one is deserved by these lovely hosts and this beautiful property. Thanks Jen and Matt, we will definitely be back (but for much longer next time!)"

Flat clean, very modern with high quality goods throughout, a few very minor homely touches needed, but as Vic had only just moved in completely understandable. I have mentioned them to Vic and he is onto them already. Vic is a fantastic host, very friendly and helpful and communicated well, even if I didn't. I would definitely stay there again when down in London"
29846030,605346597,14/02/2020,25760078,Malene,"Great location close to everything and in a quiet area. Unfortunately the apartment was not clean when we arrived and there were dirty towels and bed covers from the former guests. But after some hours this was taken care of and we had a good stay. We did not communicate with the owner but with a host team, which made it very impersonal and inflexible, and there were no recommendations of good places to eat etc. in the area. But great location in the very heart of London within walking distance of most places and in a quiet street."

Shower was great, Internet was fast, the little patio (when the weather allowed it) was a super feature. It wasn't fancy but it didn't need to be, and great value for the money.
Aasa was very helpful in the planning in making sure I had everything I needed. I hope to return next year!"

There is a Tesco's around the corner for groceries and its an easy walk to the Tube.
The apartment is very modern. The shower was good (always important!), the bed was comfy (latex I think?) and it was very light filled.
All in all a good experience!"

20278161,401849822,16/01/2019,15521373,Tomas,"Akmal's place is excellent value for money. It is bigger than the pictures make it seem and the space is used well, so it does not feel like a small studio. It is very well equipped. I was visiting London for work and it was ideal; walking distance to Paddington Station and next door to the Edgware Rd. tube station. Akmal was very quick to reply to emails and check-in was straightforward. I'll stay here for future work trips to London."

35526670,583208522,28/12/2019,22625691,Magdalena,"Charlie was very responsive before check-in, I really appreciated the flexibility with the check-in hour. Small problems occurred after, as the place was not clean (floor, bathroom, kitchen, bedsheets didn't look like fresh ones) and there was a small discrepancy in regards to facilities, i.e. there was no hairdryer (I could not find it and the owner as not responsive). 
Interesting location, wonderful conversion of the church into the flats, space is properly adapted for residential use however the steps to the bedroom on the mezzanine are very very steep.

The biggest disadvantage was the fact that the flat was not clean. However, it is worth to mention that you have a free parking space which is great for people arriving with a car.
Also, very rare finding as the owner is still living int he property- not like most of the flats that are designated for Airbnb only."

15125032,588262981,04/01/2020,63138202,Khaled,This place is very over priced for what it delivers. The garbage disposal does not work in the building and the main wooden door is annoying. You have to unhook it from the bottom and hook it back. Instructions were not clear at all. Too overpriced. Better to stay at a hotel. A lot smaller than it looks in photos.
7742194,218173640,11/12/2017,160068568,Rishabh,The room was cosy and clean with a great shower and nice views of London. The place was well located near the tube with lots of shops nearby. The kitchenette was well stocked and Boris was helpful and welcoming. Can highly recommend

The extra cot-bed is comfortable, though not for someone who needs a softer bed. My mum thought the queen bed was comfortable. Kasia has a very nice kitchen, which makes everything so much nicer when traveling. The bathtub is amazing! Long and deep, and very relaxing."

Our flight arrived early (6:30a) in the morning and since the room was occupied, he offered to hold our luggage so that we could go and explore right away.  He even tracked us down when we got turned around in the neighborhood on the way to the flat.  

When we got back at the end of the day, all our bags were already in our room.  Great host!"

The room was warm, wifi goid abs nice little touches. nstructions were precise and easy to follow.  Only thing that I would say is that breakfast arrangements were not communicated  prior to or during my stay and was incomplet and this needs to be addressed pleas.  Having said that, I would definitely stay here again without any hesitation. Thanks for making good my stay a good experience"

Great spacious flat with fully equipped kitchen, comfortable bed, wifi/TV and plenty of restaurants,pubs and grocery stores just outside your front door.

All of my wants and needs had been anticipated by Allan and thoughtfully provided for.  His attention to detail is impecable. He went above and beyond what I expected from a host. The place is full of character and as advertised. It was always very clean. Transport links are great with no need to navigate rail steps with travel bags. I stayed with Allan for 11 days and look forward to staying again some day.

Dejó a 6 personas en la calle, a altas horas de la noche, teniendo en cuenta que para no tener problemas habíamos abonado 40 días antes.  Soy host de airbnb además de huésped y jamás he dejado a ningún cliente sin el alojamiento.

9817327,404791184,25/01/2019,170486847,Rany,"Our family of FIVE stayed in this apartment for 5 weeks. Here's my review in point form:

Pros:
-Welcoming staff
-Great location at tail end of the high street immediately in front of a bus stop
-A leisurely 10 minute walk up the hill to Hampstead station
-Doctors & Pharmacy just across the street
-Family friendly area in close proximity to London (takes around 20 minutes if driving)
-Apartment full of sunlight & really large windows
-Great heaters easily keep the place warm
-Great washing machine spins the clothes to an almost dry
-Considerate touches like a wheelie bag left in the apartment to make shopping easier, an umbrella and board games for the kids 

Cons:
-Close to hospital so periodically a screaming ambulance
-photography gives an illusion of a much larger space
-Only 1 television in the master bedroom and no tv in the living room which is totally impractical especially with kids
-The ""King"" bed in the master isnt actually a true king bed it's closer to an international double bed
-The hot water in the shower was very sporadic the whole trip which meant most of our showers were a mix of cold, luke warm. Also the hot water runs out quickly - it could be off peak.
-The general cleanliness would be a 5/10 mainly because everything has been over used
-We were only given 1 set of keys, I never bothered to ask for a 2nd set after reading through all the feedback and noticing zero result for others
-The fold out couch was the biggest let down (during our stay december 2018 > January 2019) stained, dirty, overly used, worn and totally uncomfortable. You can feel the springs and wooden frame through the mattress.

Overall feedback is that this apartment was not suitable for our family of 5.
None of what we experienced would be acceptable in any Hotel. 

In summary:

With a very diligent clean, minor refurb / touch up and a brand new fold out couch, a tv in the living room and an extra key: this apartment could suit a maximum of 3-4 occupants for shorter period of time or more likely 3 occupants in more comfort. This is not the place for larger families for extended periods."
6366489,343976813,02/11/2018,166720973,Nathalie,"Dès le début de la réservation, Maria m'a dans la minute guidée et proposé son aide pour préparer mon voyage, et répondait à toutes mes petites questions jusqu'à l'arrivée à Londres. Sur place, tout est très bien organisé pour l'entrée dans l'appartement. Il correspondait parfaitement à la description. Puis ça a été la découverte de la multitude de choses que l'on peut faire sur place à pied. L'appartement était très propre. Un supermarché juste à côté pour faire des courses pour manger sur place. A mon sens très calme pour une rue en plein centre ville. Un grand merci à Maria pour son organisation et sa réactivité exceptionnelle. Je recommande donc vivement ce logement."

Gentilissima, sempre sorridente...e davvero molto disponibile...anche ben oltre i suoi compiti!!
Ci ha dato consigli sulle zone da visitare e ci ha dato inoltre una mano a risolvere un problema con la compagnia aerea.

L'appartamento è piuttosto vicino alla zona dei locali, e anche se la metro dista una ventina di minuti a piedi,
davanti alla casa c'è una fermata degli autobs che a Londra sono molto efficienti e collegano bene la zona con alcuni quartieri più centrali.

Grazie ancora Eileen

There is a very nice community center/cafe a short walk away on Kitto Road and the Brockley Deli, an easy walk, has great pastries, sandwiches, etc.

Her place would suit travellers of different stripes.    When Sharon is around, she is warm and welcoming but gives you your space. There are many shops and restaurants nearby in all directions, and Hampstead Heath is not far if you're keen on time in nature. If you're in doubt about anything before or during your stay, Sharon is quick to reply and easy to contact."

The kitchen is very well equipped, all new. The decoration is nice, the spaces are large enough, with great light from the outside.

Both rooms and bathrooms very comfortable. Everything very clean.

Our host Nur was very responsive. He answer my questions very quick. And Martin, the man in charges of the building was always ready to help.

I fully recommend this apartment."
20232873,194748567,17/09/2017,147509561,William,This is a quiet and secure flat that has all that you need for a short or longer stay. Secure private parking was very helpful to me: alternatively there is a regular bus to the underground station. Joan was a very welcoming and helpful host and I felt at home in Natalie's flat.
18763122,231442630,01/02/2018,93341636,Ronald,We had such a lovely stay with Marina and would highly recommend. I think she should be designated as a super dooper host.

Living space was nice with plenty of storage. 
Kitchen was sufficient. 
Bathroom was clean. 
There was a hairdryer and iron. 

The location was excellent. There is a supermarket around the corner. Restaurants galore and nice pubs close by. Heaps of buses on nearby Kings Rd. 10 min walk to South Kensington Tube. 
It was a little noisy on Saturday night but it didn’t go all night. 

We would stay here again."

저희가 엄청 일찍 일어나는 날이 아닌 이상 아침밥도 꼬박꼬박 챙겨주셨습니다.
집도 예쁘고 깔끔하기도 하고 Kilburn역에서 좀만 걸으면 나름 갈 만 합니다. 약간 서늘하긴 하지만 지내기엔 참 좋아요. 아 그리고 Valentine님이 영어를 잘 하셔서 영어로 의사소통하는데 문제 없었고 잘 지내다 왔습니다 "

35869483,619048692,16/03/2020,10776822,Gustavius,"I would turn down Buckingham Palace for Jean’s place. It was the perfect room for me. 

There is not a better room value or host in Camden Town, period.  With just an hour commute from Heathrow and a short walk from the tube I got to and from the airport without spending two days of spending money. 

That extra cash was spent instead on trying out the diverse restaurants in the area and beer at Hawley’s Pub. Shout out to Cottons, Doma94 and The Lost Elephant’s Kitchen (I ate here for breakfast almost every morning). 

The location gives you everything you could want from a trip to London. Walk out the door and every borough is within reach because of the abundance of underground and overground trains and bus routes. No need for Uber if you stay here I found it a waste of money and more inconvenient than taking public transportation because the drivers were always late.

Jean, her warm friendly smile and eagerness to make sure you are headed the right way or just alright made it a home away from home. 

I am very grateful I found this place I’m looking forward to my return."
957861,400964828,13/01/2019,1886129,Kevin,"Chris and Sandrine are fantastic hosts, very welcoming and the fact that breakfast of toast, jam and fruit plus tea and coffee is readily available is a great plus. I used to live in North London so know the area well, but there were various guidebooks available in our room and Chris always on hand to answer any questions. The bed was very comfy and rooms are spacious. Bathroom and shower were great and exceptionally clean. Couldn’t recommend this place enough in a quiet part of attractive north London. The added bonus of a collection of vinyl in our room was a treat, just a shame we didn’t have time to play it all! We would certainly recommend staying here."
24443461,327038938,23/09/2018,63426379,Hung,"Highly recommended. Very attentive host, and thoughtful attention to detail. Place is well decorated, well stocked with essentials. Great for cooking your own breakfast."

It was only a short walk to several restaurants and the subway station. The place was also very clean and  well equipped. I loved the fluffy towels! The bathroom and the kitchen are separated from the bedroom/living area, but we expected that as it was disclosed in the listing. Overall, Lisa’s place was perfect for our one night stay in London."

They are friends now and we just had to spend a couple of chilled out evenings with them before heading out of London. This was our second stay there already and we'll keep coming back here every time we are in the area. If you get a chance to book this place, don't miss out on it. Unless, of course, we want it, in which case I will grudge you forever for booking it ahead of us. :)"

1065051,19604004,15/09/2014,17281676,Selina,"I had a fantastic time staying here and could not recommend it enough! This was my first time using AirBnB and I'm now a convert. The house is stunning, and the bedroom was ideal (and as advertised); an incredibly comfortable bed, really beautifully decorated and everything that you could need (TV, wifi etc). I also really liked that the house is on a peaceful leafy street, I slept so well. The shower in the bathroom was also amazingly strong! 
The location is ideal, literally just taking me 5 minutes to get here from Kentish Town tube station, with lovely pubs and shops on the doorstep. 
Rosh was very friendly and helpful in organising my stay, as was her son  for my check in and answering any questions/queries. 
I shall certainly return, thanks for a great stay!"
1220209,167653109,07/07/2017,1578800,Thomas,"Our stay at Cahir's place was really great. We loved the location in Stepney, minutes walk to the tube station and a quick ride into downtown. The apartment was clean and cozy, and it was easy to make use of the kitchen to prep breakfasts. There's a great park just a block or two away w/ a big field and a loop to do morning runs, a theater around the corner, and enough spots to grab a quick bite on the way home from a day out. We were only there briefly, but neighbors seemed friendly and lots of great energy in a real heterogeneous neighborhood. Coming from Queens, NY, it was very reminiscent of home. 

Cahir and Roberto were fantastic hosts. Very communicative and responsive and helpful when we needed suggestions. Would definitely recommend to others!"
14994012,441729165,22/04/2019,178849017,Janet,"Very clean place, bathroom was large and had all the storage needed for a long weekend getaway. We happened to arrive on Easter long weekend so it was very sunny and hot. This made the bedroom a little more heated than usual. Can hear chatter and noise from surrounding neighbours but was not an issue for us as we were out most of the day."
17023623,271125876,31/05/2018,175419701,Theresa,"Adrian is a really nice guy. Helped us with our luggage and gave us some local tips. The room was tidy and the bed was really comfortable. We could use loads of stuff (coffee, tea, breakfast, etc.). I‘d choose this accommodation any time again! Short walks to the underground (around 5 min), tesco express around the corner and a beautiful sight out of the bedroom window (London Eye, Sky Garden, etc.). Useful tips for women: mirror is hidden inside the wardrobe!"
97506,12306742,28/04/2014,14254370,Jeremy,"The pictures were accurate, but I didn't expect the room to be so private. The room is in the back of the flat and is separated from the rest of the flat by the kitchen, and the window faces the garden. While I was there I hardly heard anyone. That peaceful solitude was much appreciated because I was usually exhausted when I got back from running around London. The modern bathroom and kitchen were also extremely convenient. Yet, the flat retained a neat Victorian feel that matched that of the neighborhood of Victorian brick house-lined streets and family-run restaurants. 

The best thing about staying Keith and Maria's place, though, was Keith and Maria. They were extremely accommodating and nice. Keith picked me up from and dropped me off at the train station near his flat on the first and last days of my vacation. And while I was there, they offered to make me tea at least once a day, helped me call cabs and friends, and gave me advice about where to go and what to see. They made me feel at home and gave me the impression that they really wanted me to enjoy my vacation.

In short, Keith and Maria have a beautiful place and they are great hosts. I highly recommend you stay with them.

Also, the front door design is weird and guests can get locked inside if home owner leaves and locks door behind. There is an exterior door handle lock and interior deadbolts."

The studio apartment was cosy with everything we needed and the bed was ridiculously comfy. I'd take ear plugs if youre a light sleeper as there is some noise from the neighbouring rooms in the house but nothing extreme. The place is in a great location with shops and restaurants a short walk away and the bus stop at the end of the quiet residential street takes you to an underground which is a 30 min journey to Kings Cross. We would recommend this for a couple for sure.

Parties communes sales, bouts de nourriture dans le frigo, pommeau de douche cassé, poils sur les murs et le tapis de bain! 
En ce qui concerne les chambres, les placards sont très poussiéreux et je ne vous conseil pas de regarder sous le lit en plus d’avoir des draps qui grattent (sûrement pas lavés) et de la moisissure au niveau des fenêtres.
Je ne recommande pas si vous avez envie de vous reposer après une longue journée de visite Londonienne.
Nous devions rester 2 nuits et n’en avons fait qu’une pour finir dans un Hôtel! Ne vous fiez pas au images."

West Kensington Station is only around the corner so it was very convenient to travel around. Few stops to all the museums. Only little further to central.

The place is absolutely sparkling clean. Lovely details everywhere like books and DVDs (Ian is a very lovely old school person) which makes you feel like living in a home. He also provided all the cooking sauce/herb/spices for the guest so we don’t have to get a whole bunch to use only once or twice. 

The only thing I regret is that we have too few days staying in London so we did not get to hang out with Ian ❤️"

13025588,97953878,29/08/2016,17113652,Tabea,"It's a quiet and safe area to stay in London, but it needs long time to Central London. The appartment was not verry clean and Syeda was coming after 4 days home and we didn't know about their trip. We were a little bit dissappointed. I often travel and I stayed in a lot of different flats but I never seen a kitchen who was so dirty and dusty. Maybe I have a demanding expectation..."

The owner provided detailed notes on the neighborhood transportation, grocery shopping and restaurants.  You will enjoy having several pubs and restaurants mere footsteps away."

12272416,256700979,23/04/2018,158285693,Rebecca,Such a perfect location to enjoy all London has to offer. Soho is fantastic and it’s easy to walk or take the underground to enjoy all the other parts of the city. The flat is bright and spacious and enjoyable.
7408042,406651227,30/01/2019,336449,LeeAnn,"This place is far better than the photos make it look.  Very very roomy.  Nice linens.  Kitchen has everything you need and not too much.  Has a minimal vibe- it is not full of extra stuff.  Quite clean.  Everything worked well, from the keys to the stove.  Could have fit many more guests easily (we were only two people).  Quiet, calm, great location (quick walk to the tube and busy bus routes) overlooking the park and next to a city farm.  Nice neighbourhood, good tea, coffee, decent restaurants, groceries nearby.  Lots of woodwork and stained glass, place is full of handmade details.  Fast WiFi.  I would stay here again in a minute.  Highly recommend."

17971800,178005696,04/08/2017,50102331,Malcolm,Martin is an amazing host. Email response is prompt and Martin goes out of his way to accommodate any requests. The house looks just like the photos if not even better. Location  is top notch for anyone who wants to get away from the crowds of central London but still close enough to commute there within an hour. Definitely will recommend to friends and family.

The location was excellent with many eateries nearby. Love Rosa Thai Food which was 15 seconds walk away. Love that there was always people in the Neighbourhood so we feel safe even at night. 
Dan (our contact person) was always contactable so we were able to reach him when we were in London. The instructions to check in was very clear too. 
My family will stay at Percy's place if we visit London again. 
Thanks Dan & Percy! "

40639517,597938235,26/01/2020,3288367,Craig,"I spent three weeks staying at Harry's place and really enjoyed my time there. Firstly, the house is really well-located: only a 3-4 minute walk from the underground and overground station, near two supermarkets, lots of nice cafes and restaurants, within walking distance of Upper Street in Islington and ultimately only 15 minutes away from central London. The house is located on a very quiet street, and the guest bedroom is at the back of the house, meaning that it was a very quiet place to get a good night's rest. The room is a good size, with a double bed, a large chest of drawers and lots of space for hanging clothes. The shared bathroom is very modern, with a strong, hot shower that works well. Downstairs, the kitchen is large and light, with a small balcony area that I imagine will be lovely in summer to have coffee. The house also has a large dining/living room, which is a nice place to hang out in. Harry is a very easygoing, helpful host - happy to chat and give suggestions in the area, but also equally respectful of your time and space. Overall, I would highly recommend Harry's place!"

32582210,553443730,24/10/2019,236769029,Balint,"Bad experience.

Hmm where to start... The place's only positive attribute is the great location, but that's it.

For starters, Danny charged me 20 extra pounds for a linen because I wanted to sleep in the other bed which was presented in the room we have booked with my colleague, and we did not wanted to sleep in the same bed, for obvious reasons.

Well 20 pounds hm okay, but then the linen wasn in the room, but a blanket which I could put into the linen, wasn't.
I have informed Danny the minute I have realised it. But it took two days to fix, so 2 out of the 3 nights I have spent sleeping in my street clothes.

On top of this, the heating didn't work the first night, that was kind of fixed by the second night.
Later I learned that this is normal in the UK, they sleep in 10 celsius, but if I would be a host I would understand that my guests are usually not British, and they are not sleeping in cold.

He kept bombarding me with automated messages, about matters we have discusses already, super annoying.

The ice on the cake is that we have found blood marks on the linen which we were given, I have taken pictures of it, but I can't upload them here in the review.

Otherwise I would say the check-in experience was okay and cleanness was okay too. But the above listed negative experiences ruined the trip.

I can imagine not all guests have the same problems, and I am not saying that Danny is outright ignorant. But we could have pull his weight to fix this trip."
13616165,287422545,08/07/2018,41910528,Todd,"Wonderful home on lovely street only a few blocks from the All England Lawn Tennis Club.  Small, nice room next to shared bathroom. Very quiet, facing back yard with only sounds coming from birds in the trees.  Very hospitable, friendly family. Lucy was home to greet, give key and some local advice, and gave free reign on coming and going, making it very easy to take in all I could of Wimbledon tennis one day and central London another.  A great option for staying in the Wimbledon area. "

Just one tube stop (or a 15 minute walk) from Paddington Station, with its fast trains to Heathrow airport. Nice quiet street with a few shops conveniently nearby for groceries etc.  The interior is clean, modern and comfortable. Eric, the host, is exceptionally friendly, helpful and accommodating. Would absolutely stay there again. A+ Airbnb, and I've stayed at more than a few."

817542,3891739,25/03/2013,5223784,Bao Mi,"Great stay at Jane's flat! The flat was clean and tidy, very cosy and a lot of space. Because it is not much personalized, it feels like more than staying at a hotel but less than invading someone's home. There is a washing machine, tv, free wifi, towels available, a great and spacious bathroom, a great view on the park, and all that in a brand new appt complex very near the Borough tube station. It is also very quiet. Jane left tea and coffee for us to use, and even cookies! Which was lovely of her. She was very helpful and answered my questions quickly, the communication was great. The only problem was that I had trouble knowing where to go and where the conciergerie was when I first arrived - but that is mostly because I missed it. The door to the appts is quite small and hidden. Other than that, perfect stay! I highly recommend it."
1003867,546910122,14/10/2019,286816433,Shwetaa,"I stayed with Jocelyn and Linda for over a month and the stay was very comfortable with flexible check in times and breakfast included everyday. The place is connected by a 10 minute bus to the East Croydon train station as well as in walking distance to Wadden station. The house has a beautiful garden that is well maintained. Even though there were other airbnb guests, everyone was considerate of others. I had some issues getting the shower to work at the correct temperature for me but it was not much of an inconvenience. Jocelyn  and Linda put a lot of efforts including building a reading desk for me from its spare dissemble parts and also helped me with washing my clothes for a discretionary fee when required. The room I stayed in was very spacious for one person with a big closet that helped me to unpack my luggage while in the temporary accommodation in my transit time while I found a permanent place in London."

The rooms were clean, spacious and nicely decorated with antiques which drew me to the property in the first place.  Loved the country kitchen which gave a traditional feel to the house.  The views from the living room and the bedrooms towards the high street were spectacular and our family spent the afternoon just people watching while enjoying tea and coffee.  

The host was patient, friendly and very accommodating especially since we had delays reaching the apartment on time. Plenty of great places to park nearby which could otherwise be arranged by the host.  Highly recommended and likely to return to stay back there again.

Siamo arrivati all'aeroporto di Stansted e Sarah ci ha consigliato un tragitto per arrivare all'alloggio, ci ha accolto calorosamente e, nonostante non richiedessimo tanto visto il breve periodo di permanenza, la casa ci ha soddisfatti a pieno offrendoci tutti i comfort di cui un inquilino può aver bisogno. Era pulita e provvista di un po' di alimenti, la lavastoviglie ci ha fatto risparmiare del tempo e io e i miei sei amici ci siamo trovati a nostro agio. Si trova a poca distanza dalla metro da cui passa la linea Victoria, ma l'abbiamo sfruttata poco poiché nella strada principale passa un autobus che porta dritto al centro. Così ci è stato facile raggiungere in circa dieci minuti il parlamento e Westminster, e altrettanto veloce è il ritorno.
Di fronte all'alloggio si trova un supermercato della catena Tesco, un fruttivendolo, un ristorante italiano, una banca e una pizzeria. La zona è molto tranquilla ed elegante.
Siamo rimasti molto soddisfatti di questo viaggio e se torneremo a Londra -cosa molto probabile- sceglieremo ancora la casa di Sarah."

Having an elevator is a plus. A couple of small repairs are needed at this place but it would not stop me from picking this place again. 2 min walk to Embankment station and about 5 to Charing Cross and Trafalgar Square. Cabs stop right next door. We were able to use Netflix and YouTube as well as tv, not that we had the time to watch. The building is very nice, old and interesting. The beds and pillows are comfortable.  Thanks for a good stay!"

11336658,109413842,21/10/2016,87091239,Theresa,"Great location for Kington upon Thames.  
Parking is a little tricky if staying for more than one night.  Most of the streets are residents only.  We were directed to the little car park about 100m up the road which provided the first hour for free, max 
stay 4 hours, chargeable between 9am and 5pm Monday to Saturday.  This suited us but maybe an issue for others.  
We received a code to get into the hotel and a little note was waiting for us with details of our up graded room and wifi code etc.  
Lovely impression provided by the guest lounge and reception area.  The room was very well appointed, toiletries, iron, hairdryer, selection of drinks and biscuits, desk, very large TV (didn't test it), jacuzzi bath (wouldn't choose to use) with shower over.    Lots of mirrors, clean, lots of storage space.  Main issue was that the 4 poster bed is unnecessary and made the room feel smaller, the bed was also quite noisy, bedding was good quality, curtains were reasonable quality but not totally blackout.  I'm not used to a sprung mattress, so would appreciate a foam mattress topper to iron out the springs.  Really impressed with selection at breakfast, including soya milk and gluten free selection.  Cereal, toast, fruit, yogurt, pre-packed pastries and more.  For the discounted price we paid for two I would highly recommend a stay in this quiet, clean establishment.  Communication with Denise was very good."

Just be aware that the bed in the big room and the sofa are quite old and not very comfortable. 
It’s not a place for morning  light sleepers, the neighbors make a lot of noise very early (6-6.30AM) and aircrafts are flying very close some mornings at 6PM too. 
But the place is quiet in the evening and during the night, it’s comfortable with a big bathroom."

His apartment is absolutely adorable and in the perfect location. Extremely safe and relatively quiet compared to other parts of the city. You can pretty much walk everywhere, or hop on the bus (1 minute walk) or subway (5 minute walk). I would highly recommend staying here!!!"

Her cosy flat in Queen's Park is clean, well-decorated and fully-loaded with everything you need, especially if you love cooking like I do! The location is a 5 minute walk from multiple train stations and bus stops, including the underground and overground, and Salusbury Road, which has some great pubs and restaurants! Queen's Park Sunday market is lovely as well, and shopping establishments line Salusbury Road and Kilburn High Street.

The place is very central and only a 5 min walk to the tube station - which makes for quick access to Westminster, Big Ben, Parliament and other notorious areas. What made our time special in London were the countless recommendations offered by Emma and her husband that took us outside of the ""traditional must-sees"" in London to unique activities, eateries and neighborhoods. Within walking distance of Emma’s residence are an array of multicultural restaurants and a fantastic, traditional pub! As first-time visitors, our host made sure we saw the city’s charm.

The room and bath is very clean and spacious. The home has a personal touch of Emma’s art, which quickly made our space a home. At all times, Emma offered tea, coffee and even essential oils when my mother was coming down with a cold. Taking advantage of the massage offerings, my mother stated it was worth every pound! Over our week stay, we were fortune enough to share a breakfast and dinner with these wonderful hosts. 

This place is ideal for people wanting a home away from home – if and when I visit London again I look forward to staying with Emma!

As crianças queixaram-se que o colchão do sofá cama é um pouco duro, mas o cansaço era tanto que conseguiram dormir nele. O único apontamento menos positivo foi de facto a limpeza das loiças na cozinha, não foi agradável abrir os armários e encontrarmos os copos e canecas bastante sujos. Deveriam ter um pouco mais de atenção a esses pormenores. Recomendo este apartamento para quem quer usufruir da cidade e ao mesmo tempo ter um local onde possa descansar tranquilamente."

Tricia and Simon are wonderful hosts, on hand to assist if needed, friendly and attentive at all times.  The room was charming, and I particularly loved the view over a much loved, back garden.  I honestly felt as if I were staying in a country home, in the middle of London.  Nothing was too much, lovely little details, provisions, fresh towels and linen, and all the information you may need about the area.  The room and en-suite bathroom was spotlessly clean - the decor elegant and classical.  A charming experience.  For my first encounter with Airbnb, I think I found the place I will always want to stay in when I am visiting in London.  Well done to Tricia and Simon, you are lovely people and made me feel very special.  Until next time and thank you for everything."

Aunque con niños pequeños, es obviamente imposible de controlar algo así porque son eso, niños. Por lo demás estuvo todo muy bien. La habitación, reformada e impecable."

Beds were really comfy, lots of useful home comforts to make life easy and I slept better than I do at home!  The host Megan was amazing in helping us out getting the keys when I had to work late and I can't thank her enough for being so accomodating."
15137531,528638970,13/09/2019,217871835,Tadaaki,It was nice experience to stay in the apartment.  Spacious living room and nice bedroom. Check in process was smooth if you just follow the instructions.

Mo & Elana have taken great care to ensure we had comfortable, enjoyable experience and I recommended them 101% as the best, most gracious and helpful hosts you could ask for. Mo was available and very quick to respond to all our needs. Without a doubt this was one of the nicest places we have stayed at and recommend it wholeheartedly. Thank you Mo & Elana."
19929424,427777612,24/03/2019,113738224,Saif,"Great place, just as you’d expect. Just a few minor things to note, the apartment is supposed to sleep 2 people however  the sofa bed was too small to sleep an adult (maybe a child). Luckily this wasn’t an issue for us as we just slept on the bed. Also, we couldn’t find any soap, body wash or shampoo in the apartment and had to purchase our own for our stay. Besides that the place is great and the location is even better!"

64429,265773453,18/05/2018,4779698,Anna,"Julie was very understanding and flexible about our arrival time which was much later than we had anticipated due to circumstances outside our control. She and her partner Niall were friendly and welcoming and gave us some great tips about where to go in the area. The room itself was clean and the bed was comfortable although unfortunately quite squeaky. The room got very bright once the sun came up so we were glad we had brought our eye masks. As others have mentioned,it is near a large motorway so there was a good bit of traffic noise. Having said that,it was amazing to walk out the door into the thick of Portobello market and we also enjoyed playing with the very affectionate kittens :)"

Merci et bonne continuation"
23374631,337413458,16/10/2018,10361166,Isobel,"Great location (it's genuinely right across King's Cross/St Pancras International stations)!  Omar is wonderfully helpful and flexible with the check-in; he helped me alot with my luggage matters (carrying them up during check-in and helping me resolve my conundrum when I accidentally left a luggage upstairs when I checked out!). 

The room is small but has everything you need, with the bed, hangers to hang your clothes, a stack of 'shelves', a fridge and even a selection of tea. As other reviewers mentioned, recommended more for travellers with light luggage, as there are several flights of narrow stairs to climb, as well as a few doors to cross :)

Nonetheless, for the great location, great host and decent price, this is a place worth the stay!"

Communication was super quick, friendly and helpful from the first request throughout my stay. My flight got delayed and I ended up arriving in the middle of the night. Carlos was super understanding and patient and texted me tipps on how to best find my way at such a late hour. 

His housemates were also super friendly. There was a lock on my door, so I didn't have to worry about my things. Location was also super convenient for me - only 5 minutes walk to the DLR station - and the next Tesco :-)"

L'appartement est idéalement situé par rapport aux transports (un bus seulement est nécessaire à chaque fois pour se rendre dans presque tous les coins les plus connus de Londres).
L'appartement est très bien décoré et les chambres confortables. 
Même de nuit, le quartier ne craint absolument pas ! Alors n'hésitez pas à rentrer en transports en commun même si il est tard.
Merci beaucoup à Tony pour cette super semaine ! Big up ! "

7847003,672062878,07/10/2020,368520229,Francesco,"Very unpleasant experience.  The owner was overly stressed About covid (although living in the property but I Never saw him). He took this As reason not to provide towels! 
Also the comunication was misleading as he put this on government measures including forbidding my gf to pop in even for 5 minutes. 
Then he and his brother said different things; one said it was ok for her to come if i booked for two, wasted my time to go through a list of questions and then the other saying no anyway. 
In the end one guest was sick As they said. So I decided to leave ...and no receiving a refund after so Much madness. They said I need to be fair. 
I think they don't want to work As airbnb."

28805389,515769179,23/08/2019,85050324,Blooming,Atilla’s place is great for its very easy access to station and a renowned Harrods. Waitrose and Sainsbury are just opposite the street. Atilla himself is a great host. His responses are very quick and he arranged our check-in and out neatly. His place is great too with rooms for up to 6 people.

2957732,41718668,09/08/2015,25941681,Stephanie,"Un très bon contact par mail avec Odile dès la réservation. Odile s'est montrée très disponible pour répondre à toutes nos interrogations. Sur place nous avons été très bien accueillis et renseignés par Michelle. 
Le logement est très bien situé pour se rendre en métro dans le centre de Londres (en une petite vingtaine de minutes, ligne rouge Central) et pour rejoindre l'ouest (Windsor est à 45 minutes environ en voiture), plutôt spacieux (nous étions 2 adultes et 3 enfants), bien  équipé, et propre. 
Seul bémol: sachez que si vous voyagez en voiture, il faudra la garer dans la rue (assez facile de trouver une place) mais il vous en coûtera £2.2 par heure (pas de forfait, et uniquement par pièces), de 9h00 à 17h00, et il ne faut pas compter sur la clémence de la police locale ! Pour éviter de payer plus de £17 pour la journée, nous avons opté pour garer notre voiture au centre commercial Westfield pour £6.5 et prendre le métro à la station Shepherd's Bush ou White City, mais c'est bien dommage quand on a un arrêt à 20 mètres de la maison !
Donc nous reviendrons sans problème mais uniquement dans le cadre d'une visite londonienne en train ou en avion !

11938829,330100551,30/09/2018,21420248,Anny,"This is the absolute perfect location! The flat is very clean and open. You would think a place right on a busy street would be loud, but once you get back to the bedroom, it is surprisingly quiet! We enjoyed coffee and breakfast every morning at Flat White, which is a coffee shop right downstairs. Side note, this area is fantastic for my fellow vegans/vegetarians! So many options! Would highly recommend this place for your stay!"

3321096,32064228,13/05/2015,30544885,Donnis,"I LOVED staying here.  My entire visit was 10 days and I booked late which meant moving to a different room after 6 days.  Both rooms were great.  Very comfortable beds, spacious rooms and plenty of space for hanging and folded clothes.  I like to sleep with my windows open for fresh air and was able to do so in both rooms.  The location on Queensway was great.  There are two tube stops within blocks on the street and the buses are only half block away.   There are loads of ethnic restaurants up and down the street as well as shops.  It is a very safe accommodation as well.  Now, the best part is the hosts....Sunny and Sheila are warm, welcoming people.  They were so very helpful to me in recommending restaurants close by and transportation to various parts of town.  They are genuinely nice gracious people.  I will certainly plan to stay with Sunny and Sheila when I return to London.  Thanks to both of you for a wonderful easy visit to this special town. "

Its quiet location and the comfy bed meant a comfortable sleep at night. However, cool nightlife, bars, restaurants and shops were never further than a stone's throw, while central London and its attractions were at 20-30 mins away. Joel himself has been a great host and very helpful throughout our trip from the moment we booked the room till we left it. Overall a great experience."

The room was very clean and comfortable and you have access to all the amenities. Although the underground stations were 15 mins away by foot, the bus stop was just next to the place and gets you directly to central London (e.g. Marble Arch) in 30-40 mins. I definitely recommend to stay at her house!"

27717783,567035471,21/11/2019,14102060,Renard,"Stephen’s place is a great base to explore London without the hustle and bustle of the inner London. It is only about 15-20 minutes walk to Queenstown station or Battersea station and from there only one station away to Victoria. Buses are also aplenty. I would recommend taking the buses because they stop right in front of the apartment.

The apartment is bigger than I expected for a one bed room unit in London. The design itself is funky, a bit on the rustic side but I like it! Stephen is also a very nice host, he provided the basic stuffs like coffee, tea and even bought a bottle of milk for my 1st day. Thanks Stephen, will certainly back to your place when I’m in London."

29891915,466347214,09/06/2019,57112345,Pamela,"We absolutely loved this flat! The location is incredible - central but also quiet - and we were thrilled to find such a spacious flat with room for all the family. The beds were incredibly comfortable, there were plenty of big, fluffy, white towels, and the flat was really well stocked with all of the basics we could need. There are numerous supermarkets and cafes within a couple of hundred metres from the front door, and it was only a few minutes' walk from Victoria station, which was perfect for us.  The check in process was great and we were really impressed with the communication beforehand - particularly when we had to change our arrival time - and the arrangements for check out couldn't have been easier.  The style of the flat is a bit retro, but that simply added to its charm! It had everything we needed and we really enjoyed our short stay. We wouldn't hesitate to book this flat again for our next visit to London and hope to be back soon. Thank you!"

Appreciated that there was laundry detergent and other basic amenities not included in some other places we’ve stayed. Only drawback would be sofa bed that’s uncomfortable and worn out.  First day we had a tough time with the key to the outside door.  Called Harry and he answered right away making sure that the key was fine (it was). Would definitely recommend staying here!

The apartment is new, after renovation, fresh and clean, but there is no elevator (3rd floor) and no air conditioning (like in most apartments in London). Alex is a generous and wonderful person and owner, he took care of us and was available 24/7. The apartment looks exactly like in photos. It is convenient for 2-4 people, equipped with everything you need. The area is so good! There are no tourists)) The district is very family, safe and quiet. It is 5 minutes walk to metro (central line), 10-15 minutes walk to Wholefoods and M&S foods and shopping area (Zara, H&M, Gap and so on). I also liked that the apartment is like a hotel (without owner’s cloths, books, photos and other stuff). So, if you are looking for light, cosy, stylish, new and fresh flat in London, this one is the best choice. We loved it a lot and will definitely book it for our next trip to London.

The area is quiet (except from the tube - it may be good to have earplugs for the night because the walls are thin) and nice. There is a bus stop nearby which will drive you to the Thames. We arrived later than expected and there was no problem with Judith and Luis to adapt. The house is big - around 12 bedrooms maybe - and well furnished. The kitchen is really nice and breakfast is offered by the hosts. There are 4 bathrooms and they are very clean. The only ""bad"" thing is the smell in the bedroom - like litter - maybe due to a problem of humidity. But this is not so bad and we enjoyed our stay anyway."

14239782,262878005,10/05/2018,13490658,Nicole,"Julie and her partner’s flat was what we needed for our short stay in England. Julie was very accommodating and let us check in our bags and stored them a few hours before check in, which we greatly appreciated. Julie’s place is a 3 minute walk to the train station (New Cross Gate) and conveniently has a grocery store nearby (Sainsbury). For those who have restricted mobility, be advised there is a fairly steep hill to climb. The room was a decent sized and the bed was very comfortable. 

Pros: 

* Close to train station & grocery store 
* In a quiet neighbourhood away from tourists 
* Host was very accommodating and friendly 

Cons: 

* The room was very cold at night and since it was in the basement it was a little damp
* Upstairs noise was a bit loud in the early mornings which woke up us a few times (understandable) & residence can be noisy in the garden beside the door 
* Only recommend staying for a few days (2-3), would not recommend for a long period of time 

We appreciated everything Julie and her partner did to accommodate us and it was great for our short stay in London. Thanks again!"

The neighborhood is incredibly convenient with great restaurants, super markets and tube stations.  There are three lines within walking distance and Paddington station so you can get anywhere pretty quickly.  Jenny has done a terrific job having meaningful extras available in the house such as hair dryers in the rooms, Netflix access and soap and shampoo in the bathrooms. The kitchen was well stocked, there are quality bath towels and bedding in the rooms and a nicely designed, comfortable living room for relaxing in the evening.

We had a great time with our family touring London and relaxing at Jenny’s place when we returned after a long day."

1585716,45259599,01/09/2015,36912691,Sean,Toby and Anetta 's apartment was exactly advertised and spotlessly clean. It was ideally situated for exploring London but secluded enough to relax. It is somewhere I would recommend to others and would use in the future again myself. Overall a great stay made even more enjoyable by the quality of the apartment.

You will surely sleep on pillows that smell so nice:)) You have everything you need at place.  Great location. 44 bus gets you to Victoria in minutes. You can even walk. Rey makes sure you are well guided about the city. We had conversations even in Portuguese:)  Thanks for everything. See you next time!

It is such an amazing apartment, and we regretted not being able to stay longer. Both Gosia and Simon are very nice and hospitable, and gave us the space we needed as well as being interested in talking with us. In the morning there was plenty of cereal, bread and spread for brekfast and she left us some bananas to take with us - which was lovely since we'd be walking a lot. We could check in and out as we pleased, they just left a key with the concierge. We could also come and go as we pleased during the day and they gave us pointers to places to see and eat in the area. 
The whole building is safe, clean and only a short walk from the tube. The apartment is lovely, bright and clean and Gosia left us towels, shampoo, etc.
Overall, this was the perfect stay. "

Our first breakfast was already in the refrigerator, wine and cold beers were also readily available. Email communication prior to the visit and the handover of the keys were easy. The hosts were very helpful and welcoming...thanks!
The neighborhood is very calm and perfect for a peaceful retreat after spending the day in busy London. We used the bus connection to London and (Website hidden by Airbnb) problem there, it only takes a short walk to the bus stop. In summary: highly recommendable place! We were glad to have stayed at the Bowling Green House! "

16685319,199610223,02/10/2017,46593076,Imogen,"Sam's place was good for a night. The bathroom was down a set of stairs and out in the hallway of the building, which wasn't ideal, and our bedroom didn't seem to have a lock we could use to make sure our belongings were secure while we were out of the apartment. Otherwise Sam was perfectly nice and communicative, and the bedroom was large. I wouldn't recommend this for older couples, or anyone looking for privacy or quiet."

The house is conveniently located and it is very easy to get in and out to the city centre. The nearby tube stop was closed for renovations for two days of our stay but despite that we were able to get the bus and Uber into the city for relatively cheap.
Sher’s house was lovely and tidy with plenty of fresh towels, extra bedding and was lovely and cozy with the heating on, and being just off of the main road meant it was also lovely and quiet at night.
There we also shops nearby (Asda, co op, sainsburys) and many options for food from Uber eats.

Thank you very much :)"

Everything is 5star apart from the stairs that you have to climb and the fact that you would hear upstairs neighbour walking around. Not that it’s annoying but I thought it should be said.
Karolina herself is amazing and answers your questions in a matter of seconds. I don’t think you can find a better place in that area within the price range."

Her place is very clean and beautiful, and has the amazing balcony! Location is great also, close to couple different tube and bus stops. I would totally come back and stay at her place next time I'm in London! "
4669647,87027925,18/07/2016,2420009,Akim,Everything was perfect. Owain was very reactive and flexible regarding check-in/out time. Location is perfect to move around with bus or underground.

The location is super convenient to public transport, making it very easy to get around London. One thing to note is that the room and bathroom are small, perfect for my needs but if you like to spread yourself out, this may not be the place. Overall, highly recommended for those who are a bit adventurous and don't mind some grit at their doorstep."

They couldn’t have been more friendly and went beyond their duty to help us, for example, they met my mum while I found parking which incidentally was nearby and reasonably priced for London!, helped my mum up the stairs with our luggage and with an unexpected special delivery of train tickets! 
The Porridge and fresh berries for breakfast were absolutely delicious..  
Thank you Z and Alex for a wonderful stay in a very interesting neighbourhood! Just wish I could have stayed  a bit longer ..hope to see you again another time. "

Lots of Ikea stuff, but all new and in good condition. The windows are big and bright, and most of them open, creating a nice airy atmosphere. Wifi works well. There are tvs, but we did not turn them on. The backyard was awesome and has actually been upgraded from how it looks in the photos. The back benches have been painted, the grass was nicer, and there are light-grey stones and outdoor lights along the side where the trees are. There is also a comfortable table on the wooden deck and a heat lamp (we did not use it because it was not cold). Nicely updated kitchen and fully stocked. The master bathroom does not have a proper shower, only a tub with a hose to hold over your head (this may be a British thing?). The back bathroom however has an awesome shower, but is only accessible by walking through either of the back bedrooms (or by walking outside). This was not a problem for us, but could be depending on the group. Its just a good fact to be aware of... Either way, we had a great stay and would absolutely return. Manfredo responded to all messages relatively quickly (extra fast while we were there). There is also a great restaurant / upscale pub right at the corner (The Little Bonaparte). "

I could really feel that they were from hotel industry background with their attention to details such as lighting for reading etc. It was also really good value for money considering the location. Bus 87 takes you straight to Trafalgar Square and Aldywch. You can also take 28 to Notting hill gate station if you want to explore that part of London. Most of all, I was checking out during this bank holiday weekend and Antoon extended as far as to drop me off at Pimlico station to ensure I'm  not late for my train. I really recommend this place and will definitely stay again."

Sie hat sich bemüht uns alle relevanten Informationen zu geben, hat uns eine Wegbeschreibung gegeben und war da, als wir ankamen. Wir haben gleich den Schlüssel bekommen und konnten uns frei bewegen. Sogar etwas zu Essen hat sie uns angeboten und Wasser bereitgestellt. Sie ist wirklich hilfsbereit und freundlich. Wir haben sehr gut geschlafen und alles hat funktioniert. Das Schlafzimmer war absolut sauber. Die Lage ist hervorragend und wir kamen mit dem Bus schnell in die Stadt oder liefen zu Fuß zu den Camden Markets. Wer günstig und zentral wohnen möchte, aber keinen Wert auf eine top moderne Einrichtung legt, weil man hier nur schlafen und sich fertig machen möchte, ist hier bestens aufgehoben."

Fortunately Ivana was able to help but I would reccommend getting the train or coach up if you're staying here. The host was lovely and makes a great cup of tea. Would definitely reccomend staying with her.

26655009,665028131,17/09/2020,24708200,Law,"Was an OK stay. Nothing too fancy, has the basics. Bed, TV, small kitchen and small bathroom. On the plus side, check-in was very easy with clear instructions and apartment is only 5 minutes walk to West Kensington station, and lots of shops and food places nearby. Bright space with lots of natural light. On the downside though, there needs to be so much improvements that need to be made in future. The whole place was much smaller than expected considering the price it cost for the night. The large windows could have really used some mesh curtains and the windows look straight out to the street from the bed, anyone that walked past could see straight into the place at eye level. I had to hang some towels on the windows to prevent this. The decor wasn’t as pictured on the listing though. No colourful duvets as expected just plain white sheets on the main bed, which to be honest were not the cleanest. The futon bed on the upper level wasn’t even made just the pillows and sheets in a corner, exposing the futon mattress which wasn’t very clean you could clearly see all the previous stains on it. Luckily I didn’t sleep on there. The TV was so dusty and hadn’t been cleaned for months due to the thick layer of dust that had settled on it. My advise to the host is to make sure their cleaners actually deep clean the apartment properly and throughly especially during this current pandemic, and was not really up to a good standard. The worse thing was the main bed didn’t have a headboard and was right up against the wall. I could hear and feel the banging from the front door consistently as the bed is adjacent to the main corridor of the building. So I couldn’t really sleep comfortably or get any rest, it was so annoying, I had to check out early that night and stay at a friends place instead because mainly of this reason."

44204525,707064364,07/11/2020,225099073,Justin,"This is a university apartment building.
-laundry machines are broken and expensive to get to. The post never mentioned this. The people working there can’t help you as the laundry machines are another company. You’re left to figure everything out on your own.
-the company you communicate with on Airbnb is completely different from the one you interact with at the building causing all sorts of issues prior to arriving and after I checked in
-the view is really nice
-broken door when I arrived (lock didn’t work).
-the people are strict on what you do and how you move about the building (expected as it’s a lot of students in university that need direction). Have to show ID when you come back late at night. Have to check temperature every single time you walk-in. It’s a hassle and was a bit stressful at times.

Stay away from this Stay unless you absolutely have to."

The shower works great and the it has a fully functional kitchen. Overall, a great stay! "

She was very responsive in the weeks leading up to our stay, putting my mind at ease as I tied up all of my other travel details.  She was at the apartment to meet us the day we arrived.  Her pleasant and warm demeanor instantly made us all feel welcome.  She reviewed necessary details of the apartment, which could also be found in a small packet that we could review if we needed assistance throughout our stay.

The actual apartment is beautiful and spacious.  If anything, the pictures in the listing do not do this extraordinary space justice.  My travel group of 5 had plenty of room and felt like we were living in luxury for the 5 days we were in London.  Location is great - short walk to train, bus and supermarkets.  Definitely check out the cafe at the end of the block!

I would definitely recommend Carolina and her gorgeous space to anyone looking to enjoy London in luxury!"

The room was perfect with lovely little touches (water, little snacks) with a lovely view across the garden. The space was private as the room has its own floor. And the location was great, despite being out of central London the tube was only 10 minute walk and super easy to get places. I will most definitely be returning. Thanks Geraldine!"

It is also very practical, two beds, the master is huge with plenty of space for luggage (and great curtains to keep heat in and early summer light out); a bathroom and a separate toilet. WIth a wonderful view over their lovely garden from the kitchen and sitting room.

The location is also fantastic, just a short walk from the train or underground; easy to walk to even with the 4 suitcases we had.

Shopping and dinner options are also numerous on the nearby West End lane.

Wendy was also great, excellent communication about the place, and arranging to be met when she was called away the day we arrived - and very responsive on email for any questions even during that time - and fresh scones on arrival was a lovely gesture!!  She popped up to meet us, but asked for a convenient time first, and gave us some great local advice. "

There is enough space for two people with luggage. The apartment itself is situated far of the city. The next Tube Station is 23 min from the apartment, the bus is right in front of the house, but it took us one hour to get to the city. The motorway is right in front of the house so it is really loud especially when the windows are open. We had some problems with the check-in. The hosts are kind, but were not communicative and did not really talk to us, that was a bit sad. We had wished to get some tips like where the next supermarket is or tube station. If you want to see London city we would recommend to stay a bit nearer to the centre. Except for the noise, the apartment was nice."

4245405,162965189,23/06/2017,40846780,Henk Jan,"We (5 gentlemen on a study trip to London) truly enjoyed staying in Kiran's apartment. It's a clean, proper and nicely decorated place. Since we had to visit many of London's famous highlights, the location of the apartment was superb! Just a few minutes by foot to the Great Portland Street Underground Station, taking you swiftly to wherever you need to be! 

Kiran's communication has been excellent from the moment we booked till we left the apartment. Instructions were quite clear and the apartment was spotlessly cleaned when we arrived. Hardly will you find a better suited and located apartment North of the Thames for a better price. Definitely a great deal considering the price!

If you are looking for a pleasant stay in Central London with 4 to 5 persons, we highly recommend you this apartment!

거리와 집은 영화에서나 봤던 그런 곳이더군요. 
처음에 도어벨을 누를 때도 이 집이 맞나 싶었구요.

참! 무엇보다도 좋았던 것은 호스트분의 완전 품위있는 태도와 말투였습니다. 

내부에서 위치는 지하 0.5층 정도의 느낌인데 호스트분들의 생활공간과는 살짝 분리되어 있습니다.

화장실은 굉장히 크네요. 가족과 같이 사용하는 화장실인데 물내릴때 방법을 처음 도착했을 때 굉장히 강조해서 알려주는 이유가 있습니다. 꼭 잘 들으시길!

그 외 시설도 좋네요. 냉장고의 음료나 과일, 베이글, 시리얼 등 취향에 따라 마음껏 먹으라 하고요.

만약 혼자 다시 영국에 간다면 재방문 의사 있습니다.

It's a great flat - very light and airy with bi-fold doors opening to a small courtyard at the back.  Amy left a detailed guide with all we could need and we loved exploring the local neighbourhood. Buses run from the end of the road and the tube is a 15 minute walk away.  It was so nice to have a real home away from home while we looked for our own place. Thanks Amy!

Kindly offered us early check in and a later check out. 

However must note, the photos were clearly taken when newly decorated . 
Things weren’t working / broken for example toilet seat and all the lights in the mezzanine. 

Also be wary if you are a light sleeper - the walls are paper thin, while sleeping you could hear the next door guest breathing/ snoring. Plus the road outside can be pretty loud.

Oh and if anyone smoked on porch, you can smell in the kitchen! 

Overall a mixed experience, came away feeling pretty tired due to lack of sleep, but the walks around Notting hill made it semi worth it."

El apartamento es lo que es, no le puedes pedir más, pero para 2 personas y si no vas a pasar mucho tiempo en él (solo dormir y desayunar), está bien. 
Es cierto como comentaban otros huéspedes, que hay algo de ruido en la habitación principal (en la interior no). Curiosamente, hay más ruido entre semana que el fin de semana. Pero la verdad, llegábamos cada día tan cansados, que el ruido no era suficiente como para no dejarnos dormir.
Ojo si vais en invierno, porque las ventanas son como papel de fumar. La calefacción funciona bien, pero nosotros fuimos en Mayo y cuando no estaba encendida hacía algo de frío. En invierno debe ser bastante frío.
Sin duda alguna, lo mejor, la zona. Llena de restaurantes, tiendas de cercanía, supermercados, y a un paso de todo. Ah! Llevad adaptadores de enchufe, a nosotros se nos olvidó y en el apartamento no había ninguno."

The flat is a good distance to inner-London and good reachable by tube & bus. Our room was lage and very tidy, also as the private bathroom.
Absolutly recommended!"

We were originally looking at another apartment of his in soho on Rupert street but ended up booking this one on haymarket. Had tons of light with huge Windows and views towards Leicester square. Alex will be first call we make next time we visit London.

L'appartement est propre et comme sur les photos. On se sent comme chez soi.
Malgré que la station de métro d'à côté soit fermée, la suivante se situe à 10min à pied et sinon il y a différents bus. Bien situé, accessible au centre ville assez rapidement (15-20min de métro).
Je recommande cet appartement, vraiment !!"
26245686,656927891,27/08/2020,312609887,Scarlett,"Initially booked a different property but due to covid couldn't stay there so we're moved to this flat. The location is amazing, so easy to get to the tube station & is a really nice, clean area. The flat is nice, just very very warm! The only issue was the kitchen amenities as we just had 1 frying pan which was completely burnt with bits peeling off it so were unable to use - but other than this the flat is perfectly fine for somewhere to sleep in between busy days in London."

The location is fantastic - it's in a quaint and centrally located neighborhood, and it's blocks from a canal, which you can always find people jogging and walking along. There are quite a few good restaurants and pubs located nearby too, including Ottolenghi, Popham's Bakery (best pastries in the city, one could argue!), Island Queen, and the Wenlock Arms. Caroline's place is very comfortable and quiet, and she was always super responsive to any and all questions I had. I would highly recommend this place for your next stay in London."

I love the bare aesthetics of the place and I was positively surprised to see there is even a large desktop computer now.  This unforgettable bright loft is the place in London I miss the most when not there. Ideal as both a work base in the city or just a special getaway, I recommend it to anyone.  "

2767880,24027666,17/12/2014,9505962,Dr. Cornelia,"Das Appartment liegt in einem netten, ruhigen Teil von London in Wapping mit guter Anbindung an das öffentliche Verkehrsnetz. Die Wohnung im zweiten Stock ist klein, einfach, aber gut ausgestattet und nett und sauber eingerichtet. Sie ist eigentlich für zwei Leute ideal, es gibt aber Schlafgelegenheit für vier Personen. Wir sind von einer Haushälterin empfangen worden, die uns die Wohnungseinrichtung erklärt hat. Die Küche mit Geschirrspüler, Eiskasten, E-Herd und Mikrowelle ist klein und praktisch. Geschirr ist ausreichend vorhanden und die Küche gut ausgestattet. Das Schlafzimmer enthält einen Spiegelschrank mit Schiebetüren, wo man sein Gepäck verstauen kann. Der Raum mit Fenster zum Hof mit Grünanlage und Bäumen eignet sich gut zum Schlafen, da er ruhig ist. Es stehen ausreichend Decken zur Verfügung. Das Wohnzimmer hat eine Sitzgruppe mit Tisch für vier Personen. Diese kann auch als Esstisch verwendet werden. Außerdem befindet sich in diesem Raum eine Ausziehcouch als Schlafgelegenheit für zwei weitere Personen. Die Wohnung ist ohne TV Gerät, aber mit gutem Wlan und Telefon. Die Wohnung ist hell und freundlich. Schlafzimmer, Wohnzimmer, Badezimmer und Küche sind sorgfältig, nützlich und geschmackvoll ausgestattet. Auch das Badezimmer mit WC ist klein, mit Badewanne, Waschmaschine, Duschgelegenheit und einigen Handtüchern ausgestattet. In der Umgebung findet man viele Grünanlagen und kleine Geschäfte mit Lebensmittel, einem Bäcker und einem Fleischhauer und einer Post. Ein größerer Supermarkt ist in weiterer Entfernung. (zum Beispiel mit der Overground Linie zwei Stationen nach Canada Water fahren, wo sich ein größeres Einkaufzentrum befindet). Es gibt einen nahe gelegenen Fußweg neben der Themse zur Tower Bridge mit vielen Parks und Aussichtsplätzen und mit schöner Aussicht auf die Stadt sowohl zur Tages- als auch zur Nachtzeit. Die Gehzeit ist ungefähr eine halbe bis dreiviertel Stunde durch das historische Viertel mit alten Werten in Backsteinbau. Es gibt auch nette Pubs, kleinere Lokale, ein Café sowie Kulturzentren mit Galerien in diesem revitalisierten Stadtviertel östlich des Zentrums. Von Tower Bridge Station aus erreicht man bequem das zentrale Ziele wie Charing Cross, Nähe Trafalgar Square oder Picadilly Circus ungefähr binnen 10 Minuten mit der U-Bahn. Die Bus Linie 100 fährt mit einer Frequenz von ca. 10-15 Minuten direkt bis zum Haus und retour zur Liverpool Station. Wenn man kein Auto zur Verfügung hat, empfiehlt es sich, sich eine Wochen- oder Tageskarte für sämtliche Linien zu lösen. Die Nachbarschaft ist ruhig und sicher, die Gegend mit den revitalisierten, historischen Schiffswerften ist ziemlich grün und verkehrsberuhigt. Die nächste U-bahn Station (Wapping Station, Overground) ist in 10 Gehminuten entfernt, die nächste Autobushaltestelle befindet sich vor dem Haus. Mit der U-Bahn bis zum Zentrum benötigt man ca. 20-30 Minuten. Die Anleitung der Gastgeberin für die Anreise war präzise. Mit der Autobusfahrt vom Flughafen (großes Verkehrsaufkommen quer durch London), der Busfahrt zum Appartment, Ticketkauf und Wegzeit zur Busstation hat diese aber längere Zeit in Anspruch genommen als uns vorgegeben war. Wir haben Hristina nicht persönlich kennengelernt. Als Gastgeberin legt sie größten Wert auf Pünktlichkeit, daher sollte man bei der Anreise unbedingt einen Zeitpuffer einplanen, da nach unserer Erfahrung Verzögerungen Zusatzkosten seitens des Gastgebers..."

She is so kind ,I felt like she is the person whom I met before.The room was cozy, clean, lovely scenery from window. The place is very convenient and quiet , which is close to bus stop.
It takes 15 to 20 minutes from kings cross station.
The breakfast was nice, she prepared everything what I wanted.
I love her characteristic and everything.I spent a nice time with her.
If I have any chance to stay in London,I'm sure I'll stay her room .
I won't forget about her and the days which I stay in her flat.
My daughter also had a great time in your flat. 
I want to say thank you to Ms. Dieneke!

22428604,706888982,06/11/2020,32657106,Mike,This is a great find. It is well located for public transport and road connections. The place is spotlessly clean and has everything you need including peace and quiet. The host is so helpful and communication is easy. Excellent.

What I loved most were the thoughtful details throughout. The artwork mugs, plates, rugs, and furniture  all seemed to have been specially selected for the space. It's also close to some great places--Victoria Park, Regents Canal, Broadway Market, were all a quick walk away. I'd definitely stay here again."
193794,10442237,18/02/2014,2579632,Gil,"Had a great 3 days stay at Andrews place.
Room was as advertised and perfect for one person.
Andrew was welcoming,helpfull and plesent and made me feel at home right away.
The place was very tidy and clean and it shows andrew takes great care of it.
It has a lot of windows for the sunlight to come through and the view is very nice too.
It was about 5 minuets walk from earl's court tube station and it takes around 20 minuets to get to the centre of london which was great.
If your coming to/from gatwick ,there is an ""easybus"" station about 15 minuets walk from the appartment. It takes around and hour from the airport.
You can go the ""gatwick express""-Victoria-Earl's court way too.
The area seemed safe at late hours too.
The only disturbing thing was passing the graveyard at 3am on the way to the easybus station :)
Price was on par with other airbnb rooms in the area and was well worth it for me.
Thanks andrew.

The apartment is definitely lived in by someone normally, which is fine, but it wasn’t clear what I had access to as a guest, and there were used towels hanging in the bathroom upon arrival and I had to text the host to figure out where clean ones were. Also, it’s on the ground floor, which is fine, but I couldn’t lock the kitchen window, which made me slightly uncomfortable."

17838574,344864299,04/11/2018,57654465,Vivienne,"Great location, near to tube stations, Little Venice and several parks. Do not expect luxury, quite basic."
30350653,607119697,17/02/2020,195392508,Jack,"This place is a great choice! If you’re looking for location (close to a lot of theaters, shopping, museums, local attractions, and food all within walking distance), new to the country (great safety features), and like luxury without breaking the bank (beautiful space, clean and simple), this place is for you. Communication through the app before and during the trip is the way to go, especially if your not from London. This was a great place to stay on our first trip to London and we highly recommend it to anyone looking to feel like they’re really a part of the community and culture."

That was such a huge perk as we didn't have internet access on our phones. Super close to an underground station and multiple bus stops. Beds were comfortable. The biggest negative was the poor window insulation. You can hear everything going on outside, especially from the front bedroom. It was small as described and doesn't have much storage but there were baskets and other items to help with that. Overall, would highly recommend staying here!"

I really enjoyed our conversations over tea and excursions to a local antique store and breakfast cafe.  Her home is lovely to match. The decor is gorgeous and memorable, reflective of Sara's creative eye for things.  My room in particular was the ideal place to relax and unwind; I couldn't have asked for anything better.

The location of her place is a close walk to both the West Brompton and Earls Court Tube stations, near plenty of high streets with food and shopping in a quaint, peaceful neighborhood. Sara knows a lot about the area and has great ideas for things to do in London that only a local would know to try. She is more than happy to share her wealth of information and spend time making you feel at home in her flat as well as the city itself. 

I greatly valued the time I spent with Sara in her lovely flat and wouldn't hesitate to stay here again!"

It also has a Tesco supermarket very near, so you won't have any problem in case of wanting to prepare some of your meals at home, as well as a few restaurants nearby.
The apartment is also considerably well communicated with the city centre, it will take you approximately 30 mins to get there by bus (bus stops are super close) and there is a 15-20 min walk to the underground station of Elephant & Castle. If you consider that amount of transport-time reasonable, then I highly recommend this place."

We especially loved the location close to major transport links, with plenty of local shops and restaurants to choose from.
When the instructions for the flat were sent it included everything we might need to know and was very clear and helpful about flat access and the local area.
We would definitely stay here again for future visits to London.

45573821,704148716,26/10/2020,352299056,Виктория,"I don’t recommend an  owner Veronica and this property. 
You should know that the description is very different from what you will get. They hide information that it’s a dark narrow 4- stores house. Moreover it obviously hasn’t been  renovated  for many years.  The kitchen equipment is old and dirty.  The kitchen is on the basement floor without windows with many insects.  Washing machine is from the last century covered with fungus, calcium and dirt. Windows from 1 bedroom and  living hall face the wall, others room face the inner yard. Every morning at 6.30 you will wake up because of the street noise and workers who make renovation in the next house. 
The apartment is not comfortable itself. Lack of light, space and low ceiling are very depressing. 
Another thing we found the property in a very dirty state. To my mind Veronica didn’t refresh it before our arrival because there was black dust on the floor and tables everywhere. All lamps were out of order in the ground floor and bedrooms. The kitchen was very very dirty.  When I informed Veronica of that she told me to enjoy the space. It wasn’t the answer I expected to get. I sent her pictures of all problems and she just ignored them. You should know that Her manners are far from being welcoming. After many letters of complaints she sent a lady for 1 hour to clean carpets.  
In conclusion I don’t recommend this property and Veronica. You can find better apartment for this amount of money."

L'appartamento è molto accogliente e risponde perfettamente a quanto descritto nell'annuncio. E' vicinissimo alla stazione della metro, con la quale in sole 3 fermate si arriva in Liverpool street station. 
All'arrivo siamo stati accolti da Tamara, un'amica di Livvy, che ci ha dato tutte le informazioni necessarie per il soggiorno. Avevamo a disposizione anche un dettagliatissimo fascicolo preparato da Livvy con tantissimi consigli utili (dove fare la spesa, i migliori posti dove mangiare nella zona, ecc.).

12399394,142781822,09/04/2017,39867888,רקפת חן,"Advantages:
1. Very close to the train station
2. Quiet area
3. I got the big room which is beautiful
4. A lovely little house that provides the needs
5. Nice hostess who tries to do her best
6. She gave me a 5 star rating on how I left the apartment and the things I left :)

Cons:
1. One towel for 10 days is not enough at all, there should be more
2. Not enough to clean only once every 10 days, there is dust in the room
3. Being busy with laundry on the last day is very troublesome! It takes about three hours.. And you must to go to the Laundry shop.
4. There is not enough hot water as everywhere (make sure it's finally fixed) I showered with a bucket of hot water like in India ...
5. Time spent in conversations, photos, video, waiting for a technician who in the end did not solve the problem of hot water
6. That the hostess is not in the apartment can cause many misunderstandings and ongoing frustration in telephone conversations

All in all it was a good experience, but hot water is very basic and wasting time on a laundry vacation and very long conversations tired me. The hostess is really nice and tries to do as much as possible."

My host Kayyoum was really friendly and he made me feel so comfortable at his flat. First of all he came to pick me up from Stratford Station as he knew I will bring some suitcases to give a hand and help to me. Then the first night he have been cooking for me some dinner and the food was incredibly good. So far the welcome was really warm. We had a chance to make some muffins together haha what was so fun :) I think overall he is a great personality who generous, he have a good sense of humour and I wish I could find a flatemate like him for a long term. Oh and I really liked the little welcome pack in my room with crisps, chocolate and some candy. Was so cute from him :) I am so satisfied with his host and I would just RECOMMEND HIM!

Jo and Urska are very friendly and helpful host. They’ve shared us a lot of informations before we get there and made our trip so much easier. 
The house was clean, lovely and well decorated. We love the atmosphere very much.

The location was great, even it’s slightly away from the city centre (15mins by train) but it’s Still very convenient and easy access as the overground station only about 3mins walk from the house. 

There’s TESCO, Food Marts and also quite a lot of restaurants and take-away-stores within walking distance which I think it’s  just perfect for us, a family with kids.

We appreciate for the gifts they’ve prepared for us and also the Xbox for our kids to play, they were very happy and entertained playing It on the Xmas day (as there’s kinda totally shut in London and we can’t go anywhere on the day).

Basically everything were perfect and I’m highly recommend it for those who’s going with family.  
I’m definitely will choose their place if I’m going to London again in future."

The bedroom is perfectly clean, small but well equiped with everything you might  need to prepare yourself breakfast. Concerning the location it is a bit far from the center but with the overground and the buses it is OK.

Man sollte darauf gefasst sein mit den Schuhen bis ins Schlafzimmer zu gehen (Englisch Standard). Lou war freundlich, zuvorkommend und hat uns weitergeholfen wenn wir etwas gefragt haben. Er war sehr unkompliziert und hat uns mehr Zeit gegeben damit wir unsere Koffer am letzten Tag nicht zu den geplanten Attraktionen mitschleppen mussten."

They installed child gates for us which we thought was incredibly thoughtful. The house was lovely and comfy and our little one had a good night’s sleep and enjoyed walks in the park. If we visit London again would love to stay here.

There’s a small 6” desk light on the side of the TV,   However the light build is flickering and out. The window only opens Halfway, and you’re a level down with absolutely zero airflow.

25452410,460517788,29/05/2019,137141729,Lauren,"Aistè's (and her boyfriends) apartment is in a really handy area if you would like to visit the restaurants, bars and clubs of the hip alternative neighbourhoods of Shoreditch and Hoxton. In my opinion the price is too high for what you get though. It is probably high because people really like to stay in this area. The room is rather small. Because of the special camera it looks bigger and the bed is for two people but not the biggest size (I'm not sure what size but I think 1.20 of 1.40 m). Also it creaks, so if you are used to sleeping in a bed with the person you are sleeping with it is fine. For us, two friends, it was a bit two small. The curtain is too small for the window, so there's light in the morning. It is useful to bring a sleeping mask for that. The bath towels where small too (haha it's a theme), not the normal bath towel-size, but the size you usually use for your hands. There was no room in the fridge, it is best to make a shelf for guests. I don't know how you would be able to use the garden, because the apartment is not on ground-level. When Aistè let us in and talked to us about the apartment she did it rather fast and in a hurry. I always like it if people take time, so you can relax and adjust. Otherwise it feels too much like they are just doing it for the money. I don't know if that's the case here, but it's nicer when people really like to be of service on top of making money. I also like it if both of the people living there come to greet you, just to make you feel at home."

There is a lift which is great if you have a lot fo luggage (a lot of places in the UK do not offer that). Small room but definitely served its purpose - it was a place to sleep!
5182852,93048340,11/08/2016,75673844,Sue,"Bryan was an exceptional host. He greeted us genuinely and warmly at our (somewhat tardy) arrival, provided excellent details of the house and amenities including a breakfast in the morning, great information on buses and rail transfers, and fixed a fine cup of coffee as I was relaxing in the garden.  I believe he went out of his way to make our stay pleasant.  This was a fantastic location for our early departure from Heathrow, but he included details of things to do in central London as well as Feltham. Communication was swift and helpful.  Our stay was simply too short."

Marilyn checked in with me every day, gave me useful tips and was a pleasure to communicate with. 
Columbia Flower Market that happens on Sundays is just a couple minutes away. It is also just a short walk to Shoreditch and Brick Lane."

The place is as in the pictures, very clean, tidy and comfortable place where to stay. Location is perfect, just 30mins by bus (10mins by taxi) from Heathrow airport. I stayed there 2 days/2 nights and would definitely come back. Debbie's nice and kind person, had nice chats with her. And Toby (her dog) is a great companion as well.

It is close to the Goodge Street tube stop and several bus stops, so you have access to many parts of London. The apartment was just as described. I did find that the dryer was just as Amit described; it did not dry well. However, I was able to use the clothes drying rack that he provided, so it was no bother at all. I really enjoyed this flat and would definitely stay there again."

The hospitality was amazing, the location is terrific (only a couple blocks away from Kensington Palace!), and everyone was so nice. You have to walk up three flights of stairs so keep that in mind...but they were so sweet and carried my luggage up for me. I would highly recommend staying here if you’re ever in London!"

Very cosy and much better that a hotel.  Sharon left loads of instructions and was at the end of the phone and not too far away should we have needed her assistance or advice. Thank you again for letting us have your home for the weekend."

We totally agree with its title -- ""Luxury 1 Bedroom Apartment"": it is spacious, very clean, and has stable WiFi plus all the modern white goods such as dish washer and washing machine.  The apartment sits within a new and big residential development.  Hence, it is very safe and quiet.  In addition, there are lots of good photography books in the apartment that we enjoyed reading in many evenings.  Therefore, we really felt like we were at home while staying in this apartment.

Matthew has been extremely helpful before and during our stay.  Before we arrived, we received a very informative welcome pack via email, which explains (with photos) how to use everything in the apartment and how to get around from it.  During our stay, he promptly replied all of our email queries.

In fact, we have stayed in the Novotel (Brentford) hotel in our previous trip, which is less than 200 metres walk from Matthew's apartment.  We can confidently say that Matthew's apartment is better than Novotel in all aspects, and is much cheaper (especially for long stay).  I guess that's why everyone likes AirBnB."

Ela tem um roteiro com ônibus que passa nos pontos próximos e deu dicas dos bares, supermercados e pub próximos. O apartamento está localizado em um conjunto de prédios e o bloco da a impressão de não ter moradores. O elevador da em um hall, depois tem que sair para a sacada para entrar no apartamento, essa sacada/circulação parece abandonada, em seis dias não vi ninguém trafegando por ela a não ser nosso grupo.

David nous a accueillis à notre arrivée. Malgré un problème de fusible qui nous a privés d'électricité et d'eau chaude la première nuit, l'appartement est fonctionnel. Il faut toutefois noter que la rue est très fréquentée la nuit si bien que l'on peut être réveillé facilement par le bruit des passants et des voitures si l'on dort dans le salon.

The flat forms the lower part of a large family house & entrance is initially through the main house with access through a separate entrance during your stay which has very steep (ladder-like) stairs. The location of the apartment is really excellent, being so central to all the main tourist sites. The neighbourhood was surprisingly quiet in the evening with the bedroom being situated at the back away from any street noise. "

Für uns als Familie mit 2 Kindern perfekt, da sie sehr geräumig ist. Unter der Wohnung befindet sich ein Supermarkt, der bis 11 pm geöffnet hat. Dass sich genau über der Wohnung die Einflugschneise von Heathrow befindet, muss man akzeptieren. 
Die Kommunikation mit Veronica war perfekt, sie hat immer sehr schnell geantwortet und alles aus dem Hintergrund organisiert. Wir haben uns in den 6 Tagen Aufenthalt sehr wohl gefühlt und können es nur wärmstens weiterempfehlen."

Trains very handy to waterloo and victoria with connections into the city.  Many playgrounds and outdoor spaces nearby for children.  Restaurants and grocery stores mere minutes away.

Good sized ensuite bedrooms and kitchen was easy to cook in.

One bedroom is noisy during week nights with delivery trucks and store alarms, I imagine the weekends would be even louder so if very sensitive to nighttime noise make sure you use the back room!!

Hosts excellent with their communication."

13546088,170736428,16/07/2017,14081161,Dave,A very nice apartment with modern furnishings and comfortable bed. The living room has two sofas and a television. The WiFi was stable. The neighbourhood is fantastic - walk down Brick and also west through Shoreditch.

Charming warm welcome, chic decoration, comfortable settings. 
A melting pot area of pop culture to feel another atmosphere of beautiful London.
Everything was perfect. Congrats !"
943363,191062152,06/09/2017,5139847,Lara,"This was my second visit to Stepney House and it was even better than the first. Alejandro is a fantastic host and goes out of his way to make sure guests feel welcome. His food and transport tips are invaluable! The house is an immaculate, calm oasis from busy London, while also being very close to public transport and easy walking distance to many East London highlights."
14757410,439640930,19/04/2019,4122602,Erin,"This apartment deserves 5 star reviews based on location, value and the attentiveness of the hosts -- though it is in need of a little bit of TLC. Max and Billie were accommodating from the beginning of the reservation process, making the trip a seamless one and even allowing us to check in early the day we arrived after an overnight flight.  They were considerate hosts who were quick to respond. The apartment is very close to the Tube and walkable to great restaurants and parks.  We knew we were renting a small apartment, so were satisfied with the space for the price we paid -- honestly we didnt spend very much time in the apartment, as it was our home base after long days of sightseeing. The pros aside, the apartment is very basic without much in the way of higher-quality finishes.  It is sufficient as a place to crash at the end of a busy day, but beyond that is not a place we would have felt cozy to relax and unwind.  The loft has a mattress on the floor with very basic bedding and is not enough space to stand up and get dressed (especially if you're tall like my husband).  

Overall, a good bet for your budget, but it felt ""budget""."
529070,724340580,15/01/2021,40380550,Istvan,"Chris and Renata's place is truly a hidden gem, one that appears only in fairy tales. Their place is sparkling clean and full of lovely, welcoming touches. Just like their hospitality, immaculate! A fitting description would be perhaps: it's a five star hotel nestled in their home. Given that I had a long stay with them, I certainly did feel like having a home away from home. Highly recommended is an understatement."
10589925,617213805,12/03/2020,53725430,Oscar,Emile’s London flat was great. Just as described. Location may not be central to tourist areas but that’s also a good thing. Feels more homely. A few public transportation stops nearby so you can easily move around the city from the flat. Would recommend to other and would definitely book again if the opportunity presents itself.
2557770,105523939,02/10/2016,10403243,Hayden,"The place was amazing!  In a perfect location close to the main drag in Camden Town.  Just a two minute walk away! AJ was friendly,  helpful and met us as we got off the underground. Would recommend his place to anyone!

A nice quiet location,  but close to links to all areas of the city. Communication was always very easy, with flexibility on the check in and check out times. I would definitely recommend to others, would also return myself if in the future I need a place to stay in the area.
Thank you very much Oliver."
772992,44931693,30/08/2015,15796316,Nany,I continued my another two nights at Toral's apartment due to the comfort and spotless bathroom that I have got from my previous nights. This time around my aunt joined me at Toral's. She was pleased herself having to stayed at the lively neighborhood that made our access to public transport and tube station easier. The room we stayed was private and still we had access to her kitchen to make our morning coffee.

Our bedroom was very clean and spacious, with plenty of natural light, and the bathroom is absolutely beautiful as well. Would definitely come back here!"
6040128,59784116,15/01/2016,40794431,Heejoo,"I really enjoyed staying at Denise and Trevor's place. It is located at quiet, something like suburban area and easy to get to city center or metro stations by bus. The room is a lovely little place which has various furnitures & facilities you would need. It is located at third floor but you can get some help to carry the luggage. A bathroom is shared but only with the other guest so it is not that busy.

 You might have to learn little things while staying at this place, which is quite typical when you stay at others place, but Denise & Trevor will definitely understand and help you so don't worry.  

 You can start your morning with some converstations with them while you having a breakfast in the kitchen or wrap up your day when you using some facilities which are allowed to use for guests in the evening. So it may be a good choice for people traveling alone. Also you can get some practical advice from them.

 They are very communicative and will treat you very warm and kindly whoever you are, so I think you don't have to worry about Enlgish fluency or shyness etc...! :)"

It felt like a private apartment with the bathroom on the landing. The house, as well as the street, are both very quiet. The landlords are very discreet and gave my parents a very warm welcome. Light breakfast included. 
Very good address. "

Он дал нам много рекомендаций и мы постоянно чувствовали его незримое присутствие и заботу. Расположение шикарное - в центре всего, и, в то же время, вдали от шума. Студия маленькая, но очень милая. С удовольствием буду рекомендовать друзьям! Спасибо большое за гостеприимство! Лондон - самый удивительный город, в котором мы были. Он прекрасен!"

Nous n'avions pas lu avant de réserver que l'accès à l'appartement se faisait par  sa résidence;  mais ce ne fut vraiment pas un problème: vous montez deux escaliers et l'appartement occupe seul son étage. Nous y retournerions sans hésitation.

Ihr Tee am Morgen war sehr lecker. Als die Westbourne Park Station wegen Reparaturarbeiten geschlossen war, hat sie mich sogar zu einer anderen Station gefahren. Ich habe meinen Aufenthalt in Ihrem gemütlichen Haus in einer ruhigen Seitenstraße in guter Lage sehr genossen. Das Zimmer ist groß und das Bett bequem. Dylan, Leilas Hündin, ist sehr freundlich. Die Lage ist sehr gut: In 10 Gehminuten ist man in der Portobello Road in Notting Hill, in 5 Minuten erreicht man die Tube (Westbourne Park) und es gibt auch zahlreiche Busverbindungen in der Nähe (z.B. 18 nach Euston Station, 36 zum Hyde Park Corner, 7 zum Oxford Circus, 6 nach Aldwych, 70 nach Kensington, 31 nach Camden). Ich kann die Unterkunft von Leila sehr empfehlen! Vielen Dank, Leila! ++++ Leila is a wonderful, lovely and open-minded host who always helps you if you have questions or need an advice. I loved her English tea in the morning! When Westbourne Park station was closed due to repair works, she even drove me to another station! I really enjoyed my stay at her comfortable, homelike house which is situated in a quiet side street in good surroundings. The room is fairly spacious and the bed very comfortable. Dylan is a very friendly dog. The house is close to Portobello Road/Notting Hill (within 10 minutes walking distance) and the local public transport is very good (within 5 minutes walking distance to the tube station Westbourne Park and several bus stations are also close-by, e.g. 18 to Euston Station, 36 to Hyde Park Corner, 7 to Oxford Circus, 6 to Aldwych, 70 to Kensington, 31 to Camden).

417549,5052258,10/06/2013,5779963,Frédéric,"Cette petite maison ne manque pas de charme, bien qu'un peu encombrée par le mobilier dans les étages inférieurs. (Les pièces sont moins spacieuses que ne laissent penser les photos). 
Nous n'avons pas eu le temps de profiter du jardin, agréable, mais qui est en partie obstrué par un énorme trampoline.
Lidia a fait de son mieux pour que nous passions un séjour agréable.
Le seul point noir est le canapé-lit dans le salon qui ne permet pas d'obtenir une position complètement allongée et s'avère plutôt inconfortable, (pour des adultes, du moins). De plus, il n'est pas possible d'occulter sérieusement la lumière dans cette pièce, ce qui peut gêner certains.
Sinon, l'emplacement est très bien, et contrairement à ce qu'on pourrait imaginer, la rue très calme."

The apartment has everything that you need for self catering: cutlery, knives, mugs,fridge, even an iron. Also towels are available. Our apartament was exceptionally clean, as well. The shop is just next door so it is very convenient. Hotel is situated 5 mins from the train station and London bridge is 10 mins train journey away. The host cater for our needs as we needed 2 separate beds in stead of a double sofa bed and an extra folding guest bed was also provided. We are definitialy going to stay there again!"

Özge was a great host and seems like a genuinely lovely person,  we felt extremely welcome in her home. She was very helpful with letting us know things to do in the local area, as well as other things we could do whilst in London. 

Her flat is exactly as pictured, it was immaculate and beautifully furnished. It had everything we needed for our short stay including towels, hairdryer and iron. Özge's flat is in an excellent location and couldn't be more convenient. It is directly above a Lidl and is a 2 minute walk to the nearest underground and 24 hour convenience store. We went to the Canton Arms – the pub Özge lists – it had a really good atmosphere, the bar staff were nice and the drinks were really cheap for London drinks prices! 

At both our arrival and when we were leaving, we chatted to Özge and she was interested in getting to know us and finding out about our stay in London, which was really nice. We really loved the few days we spent at Özge's place and would definitely stay there again next time we're in London. Thank you Özge! Henry and Elayne x"

21102988,462595169,02/06/2019,248263325,Maud,"Me and my friend stayed here for 5 nights. This was a pleasant time for us, because the room was clean and it was easy to acces London from here. The common areas were a little unclean and it was a bit noisy, but overall it was nice. The shower wasn't very nice because there was barely warm water and sometimes no water came out at all.

When we arrived home however we received a message that we had to pay more because apparently we made stains on our duvets that couldn't be removed. But when I looked at the pictures, i found out that these weren't our sheets and they were trying to get us to pay extra. Luckily my friend made pictures of the room when we arrived, so we could solve it with the Airbnb customer service and didn't have to pay. 

So the room itself was nice, but I would definitely recommend taking pictures of the room before you arrive, so you don't have to pay extra!!"

The neighborhood was great - out of the busyness of the historic city center, but just a few stops away from all the action.  We loved getting back to our quiet neighborhood after a day of sightseeing, and we wouldn't have seen the canals otherwise.  Great restaurants and pubs nearby.  

The building/hallway has seen better days, but the unit itself was fine. There was a washing machine, drying rack and hair dryer for guest use.  

We were 2 couples and made use of the fold-out couch, which really wasn't designed to hold the weight of 2 adults.  We made it work - got in bed each night and tried not to move.  I'd stay here again for sure!  The price was terrific. "

Semih was amazing host too, very responsible and helpful in recommending the local pubs, restaurants and places to visit!! I must say as a food lover, my favourite part was the Italian restaurant which is located only at the ground floor of the building, authentic Italian food!!!! 

I would definitely come back to stay at Semih's place again!!! Great Value for the Money!!!"

The location is amazing (5-10 minutes walk from a rail station and tube) and her place is affordable.  It's private, quiet and there's access to the kitchen. It's a basic accommodation but the value was excellent. There was very light street noise.

Chiara estuvo comunicada con nosotras todo el tiempo y era sólo mandarle un mensaje al (Hidden by Airbnb) y tener su respuesta en breve.
El barrio es realmente muy lindo y hay muchos lugares interesantes alrededor.
El único problema fue que la segunda cama (que ella agregó porque nosotras éramos dos personas) es un catre en realidad y no es tan cómodo como la cama principal, que es muy buena.
Mucho silencio a la noche, dormimos muy bien.

¡Gracias Chiara!"
102565,4892813,31/05/2013,5483189,Oliver,"We booked Anne's studio flat for three days in May. My son and I used it as a base for exploring the city (it was his first time in the UK). We really enjoyed the flat and I highly recommend it to everyone who prefers a quiet stay. The location on the south bank (the River Thames and the famous ""London Beach"" is a mere 2 minutes walk away) is a relaxing contrast to the vivid hectic of the city. Although the next tube station is a five minute walk, we never felt ""diasporized"". 

The flat itself is very cozy but much bigger than any reasonably-priced London hotel room I've been before. although the studio is build basement-level in a backyard area, there is a lot of light flooding in through a band of rooftop-windows. 

The kitchenette is functional with a fridge, water heater, toaster and a microwave oven. The shower stall can only be descibed as ""luxurious"" which is a big plus when you're a non-morning person like me... :-)

During our trip we did not meet Anne in person. Netvertheless, her friend Luise took care of us on our arrival. 

I can truly recommend this apartment for a single person or two travellers.

Apartment is as pictured and quite comfortable for a solo traveller or couple, containing everything you would need and with lots of food options and supermarkets close by. There is some noise from the street below - can be quite loud at times so if you're planning on an early night or sleep in and are a light sleeper you may need ear plugs."

Someone met me exactly when I was set to arrive, and check out was as easy as leaving the keys inside and closing the door behind me!  Charlie had left me a bottle of wine, which I never had a chance to drink but was touched by.  The neighborhood was easy to navigate and full of convenience stores, plus it was a short stroll to my favorite park in London- Battersea!  The bed was one of the most comfortable I have ever slept in and the shower water pressure was better than I expected for an old London flat.  Two small notes/tips: the remote control apparently only works at close range, and the street noise is not particularly loud but it is persistent so even this native New Yorker had some sleep challenges.  But again, best bed ever!"

We had everything that we needed and the room was perfect - with such a comfortable bed! The bus stop is just around the corner and the travel to the city centre is easy. If you're up for a walk, the beautiful Kew Gardens are also within walking distance. I would highly recommend this for anyone - we're even going back there next week! :) "

The whole residential area is very nice and quiet, and the nice Battersea park is just across the street. The area is on the south Bank of the Thames, but a brief and comfortable walk will quickly bring you to central London. The apartment windows face the railway tracks and when the windows are open there's quite some noise, but once they are closed you can only hear a faint background noise (I actually find it pleasant), I didn't have no (Email hidden by Airbnb) munication with the host is kept to a minimum; I didn't meet Yilmaz, but finding the keys at the reception was not too complicated. My only grievance is that one of the pictures shows a wonderful view of Battersea Power Station, which was the main reason for me to choose this apartment (Pink Floyd fan here); unfortunately a new set of homes in development is now enveloping the power station, so the view, while still interesting, doesn't look like that anymore. Not a huge deal, but I was slightly disappointed. All in all, a pleasant and recommendable stay."

Atticus the dog is just too cute and he will try to play with you in the garden. Everything was clean and the flat is nicely decorated.
Jeroen was very friendly and I felt like being in my own home!

The location is close to the tube and only one station from Camden. Central London is also just a few more stations away and reachable without transfer.

Last but not least, the communication with Beth and Simon was always nice and I’m sure they would help you immediately if there was any problem.

The bunk beds are so close together that you could probably reach over and touch the person in the bunk next to you.

Couple of minor things about the space to know. The walls are pretty thin and my room, unfortunately, was right next to the bathroom so every time someone went in there I heard the door open, close, lock, toilet flush, sink run, unlock, door open. And that’s a lot of times because there’s 3 rooms on the floor I was on. There’s also some weird humming noise that goes on and off periodically? I’m honestly not sure if it was from the building or outside, it is located in the middle of the city, but I could definitely hear it even with ear plugs in. They also offered a clean towel and while there were two hanging on my door when I checked in, one of them was wet so I’m not sure either were clean and ended up using my own towel I had packed. 
All in all those are very minor things for an all around great place and awesome host. Omar is quick in responding and was kind enough to let me check in a little early to drop off my bags. Definitely recommended!"

The neighborhood has a youthful, creative vibe with great pubs, and informal restaurants, as well as markets and take away shops. The apartment is spacious and comfortable--filled with interesting art and a mix of contemporary and vintage furnishings. The layout is perfect for two people or couples. There is even a sofa bed in the living area. Our host couldn't have been more accommodating and charming, and while he was in absentia, he remained in touch throughout our stay, leaving a bottle of wine and bowl of fruit as a greeting. He was always reachable before and during our stay."

18237086,221679107,27/12/2017,9441696,Sarah,"Excellent location, close by to all amenities and local shops.  We thoroughly enjoyed our stay - Venetia had recently renovated the place and the result was quite spectacular - very smart, open plan with a fabulous fireplace that kept us all warm as toast.  We stayed here over the Christmas period whilst visiting family in London and it was a perfect ""home away from home"" experience.  The property is beautifully decorated throughout with modern bathrooms and kitchen.  We slept brilliantly because of the super comfy beds - so much so in fact that we intend to buy the same mattress as Venetia - after a busy day out shopping spending time with family and all the festivities it was simply heaven to fall into bed of an evening.  I can't recommend this home or Venetia as a host highly enough - it was our first experience of an airbnb booking and exceeded all expectations - we will definitely only stay at this property in future whenever we visit our family in London."
22640516,231469321,01/02/2018,170688237,Cate,"Nice apartment, centrally located, lots of shops and restaurants around, very safe and tidy.  Michael was very helpful and assisted us at all times.  The iPad for the guests in the apartment was a unique feature, never seen anything like that anywhere before.  Also, the welcome basket was lovely too.  All together it was an awesome place, excellent value for money and I would definitely come back to stay in the apartment to when I'm in London again."

1003867,20784829,05/10/2014,21731684,Irena,"I've been in London with 2 friends and we stayed at Jocelyn's.
He and his wife, Linda, are wonderful hosts.
On the day we arrived, we got a little bit lost and when we called Jocelyn he came after us and drove us to the house.
The room was clean, the bathroom and kitchen as well. 
The whole house is nice and clean.
The breakfast was more than we expected.
Location is good, it takes about 30-40 mins to arrive to Victoria station (by train).
The only bothering thing was the shared bathroom (with guests from other rooms). Sometimes we had to wait a lot to take a shower.
Anyway, I really enjoyed my staying and I recommend this place to all who want to visit London and have a limited budget."

We must say that the place meets the exact description as shown on the airbnb site, including the proximity to the main road.  We found the place clean.  Ideal for a couple and also in terms of location.  We had a car but it is well serviced with buses to a number of places like Kingston and Putney Bridge. Will definitely stay again if in the area."
7258490,107078147,09/10/2016,46649415,Valerio,"Rich and Libby were not in town, so their friend Lois welcomed me and provided assistance throughout the whole trip. My flight was delayed and I got to London hours later than expected, and Lois kept in touch for updates and kindly waited for me until I finally reached the place.

The flat is cozy and spacious, it looks exactly like it's shown on the pictures. It is located in an incredibly quiet street, a two-minute walk to Essex Road. 
It took me less than 10 minutes to walk to the Angel tube (a really nice walk!). Alternatively, the 341 stops right in front of Dibden Street.

If you are looking for a comfortable, well-connected, central but quiet place, then this flat is the perfect place for you.

18771430,342101956,28/10/2018,40522094,Eva,"Aida was most welcoming and a lovely, warm person. She was also very accommodating with our fairly early arrival time. It was great to have breakfast things there, the bed - we thought -was very comfy and for being in the middle of London, the flat is in a fairly quiet location (we live in the country side and are used to 100% quietness at night). The room and whole flat were spotlessly clean and I appreciate Aida's willingness to use her home and trusting it to us. As we came to visit family, the location is perfect for us and we walked a lot so I cannot say anything about local transport. The description how to find the flat was very good for us and Aida was very easy to contact and responded almost immediately."

Stan's apartment is spacious and bright, in a lovely little side street that's an easy 5 minute walk to the bus or tube. Unexpected amenities like an espresso machine, towel warmer, and Sky TV made this a true haven to retreat to at the end of each day. 
Stan is great with communication, always made sure I could contact him during my 5 week stay, and kept me in espresso beans for the duration. :)
This felt like my own home and I'm looking forward to the next time I can return! Thanks for an amazing AirBnB experience, Stan!!!"

It's quiet and cozy, which makes for a nice place to retreat while on a busy work trip or chaotic tourist visit. It is well appointed (salt, oil, pans, etc.), so it made our stay convenient and easy. We were here in July during a hot week and it gets good air flow when the windows are open and it's shaded through most of the day so it doesn't get that hot in the first place. I recommend this place and will bookmark it to use for my next work trip in a few months.

The company managing this place is also awesome. We had a couple of minor issues (shower head hose broke; we asked for a fan because of the heat) and they were both addressed quickly and with timely, clear communication."

Just a word of caution to travelers with any mobility issues - the entry steps are uneven and there is no handrail. The location is conveniently located 12- 15 minutes from the tube station, but it is all uphill, so just allow yourself time if that is an issue for you. There are wonderful coffee shops, pubs and bakeries along the route. We ventured further into Hampstead to access busses (also conveniently located) and with Megan's help, found a wonderful Indian Restaurant --""Paradise"". The food was exceptional and the price reasonable. The bakery on the corner two or three doors down from the Indian restaurant became our go-to breakfast stop."

Very helpful and kind. It was a pleasure to meet Jude and stay there. The apartment is near the Piccadilly line station and a nice short walk to Alexandra palace.

The flat is well appointed with three outdoor areas, including a huge terrace overlooking Gispy Hill. The photos of Andrews flat look great, however, they don't really do it any justice, as its even better than shown.

Andrew was a wonderful host, very accommodating  and I  would definitely book this again. I thoroughly recommend this airbnb"
24420484,283715990,30/06/2018,1829822,Aaliyah,"My stay was a pleasant one, with a few minor hiccups. The great things: the apartment is modern, clean and the bed is so comfortable! Whenever an issue arose I found the owners very helpful. Minor issues: Renters should be clear that the building is a walk up. By an American reckoning the apartment is on the fourth floor. Without an elevator this may pose a challenge if you’re bringing heavy luggage. Another minor issue, there is no water barrier between the shower stall and the rest of the bathroom. To avoid flooding/slipping my advice is to use a light flow of water. Otherwise, mine was a very good stay."

Communication was very good both before and during the stay. Check in was relatively easy by picking up keys from a local(ish) shop. 

The space is very well laid out, entrance small but upstairs all the rooms have lots of space with a real homely feel. Bathroom is very nice with lovely big bath. Lounge has very comfortable sofa and good sized dining area. Kitchen very well equipped but please note there is no microwave. Bedroom comfortable and quiet away from the street.

Overall the place was really great and I couldn’t encourage people to stay here enough, I’m only sorry I couldn’t stay longer!"

Well lit and well aired, comfortable beds, spotless linen, tidy and well equipped kitchen, all with the original basic flooring and plain kitchen wooden cupboards which give the apartment a warm and lived-in feel. 
Secure building and centrally located with easy access to transport and nice area.

We even found that the sofa was comfortable enough to sleep on, so we each had our own room (we were 3).

Apart from the lovely apartment, Russell was very accommodating - he waited up to meet us coming in from our late evening flight and had everything ready including refreshments. And he allowed us to leave our bags and come to pick them up very late on the last day because we had a night flight. 

Would recommend anytime.
Thanks for everything Russell"
27087563,476990622,27/06/2019,6089561,Iain,"Mary’s kitchenette room exceeded expectations. The pics make it look just fine, the reality is that it is really fine, well specced and appointed, with thoughtful proactive touches like marking the cupboards so that you know exactly where everything is, ensuring there is a power adaptor plus some usb charging facilities and very quick and detailed communication. For someone not familiar with the London public transit system, Mary was well prepared and could mail in a second routings from the major airports. The self checkin provided ease and fluidity. The WiFi was flawless and the big screen TV setup with Netflix a welcome bonus. There are two Tescos a couple minutes walk away in each direction, and the DLR two minutes walk, which meant that getting in and out of Canary Wharf for business was the easiest thing. Santander bike rentals are dotted around also, so getting on a bike in the city is easy. It really does seem that Mary has put a lot of effort and though into running a hospitality business and does a great job of offering hotel level ease and communication and room resources, within the airbnb system. A notable item was the smoke detector, which I set off every time I made toast due to its sensitive settings. That level of attention to detail made me feel that my safety (and that of her asset!) had also been well considered, and that she was truly concerned for the well being of her guests. Thank you Mary."
37383315,658981620,31/08/2020,8517813,Megan,"The pod was set in a lovely rural location. Really easy to get to from London. Perfect for a country break. There are some nice walks nearby and the area is easy to navigate.
We had a great time enjoying sitting outside next to the fire pit (roasting marshmellows too). Also we enjoyed cooking outside and the fresh eggs that Olivia provided as a welcoming gift were so much nicer than supermarket eggs.
The cabin/pod is really cozy and comfy (good sleeps there). There is everything you need (gas stoves, heating, cutlery, blankets, etc.).
Olivia is a welcoming and friendly host, thank you we would recommend!"

The flat is located in a very quiet and colorful residential area, right in front of a part of Hampstead Heath park. It is slightly away (about 10 min walk) from Golders Green station, but the area is very nice to walk through. The flat in general was very clean, it had a nice kitchen with a lot of amenities, and a lounge area to sit and read. The room had a nice view with a large window that lit the space very well throughout the day. Amy was warm and welcoming, and kindly provided for the breakfast during the duration of my stay.

The living room is bright with big windows, and the apartment suited us two very well. It was also warm and nice (some London apartments are quite cold).
The only negative is that the cleaning could have been a bit better, surfaces like floors, tables etc were ok, but a more thorough housecleaning would be good.
Brixton is a very nice part of London, with interesting restaurants and bars, especially the arcades with shops and restaurants, Brixton Brewery and POP Brixton, a market area created with containers.
We would like to stay here again."

It's in a nice and quiet street, but you're still quite close to Mile End station which has a lot of good connections. It's also a very short walk to Victoria park which is absolutely lovely."""

34411955,590705044,09/01/2020,303567291,Manthan,"The apartment was amazing! There was so much space and it really helped that there were two floors. The apartment had everything we needed and it was spotless. The TV in the living room was also a SmartTV so it was nice to relax after a long day of sightseeing. On the other hand, the location could not have been better. We walked almost everywhere we went and the apartment is very well-secured with an outside gate before you enter the apartment. Also, communication with the hosts was wonderful as they explained what I needed to do in detail!

I did however run into some issues with the apartment. The major issue was the Wi-Fi. The first day we got there, it worked for a bit but then it stopped working. One of the hosts truly went out of his way to drop off another router and that did work, but not well. We could not get internet on the second floor and even when we were next to the router, it was very slow. 

Also, there were a few moments when the hot water went away after one of us showered. So, there was a waiting period before the next person could go take a hot shower.

Otherwise, everything else was superb and I would definitely recommend staying here!"

It was a huge apartment and quite new. Clean. Nothing more to desire for our three days to London.

Luke is awesome. He is so service-mined. He came up with suggestions and advices about transportation, things to do of both typical tourist things to more local secrets. He also bought fruits, water, milk and bread. I don’t know what he is doing, maybe competing with a 5 stars hotel. Well done, Luke."

The apartment is clean and tidy with complete living facilities. It is close to bus stops and Caledonian underground station, which is quite convenient for travelling. The apartment is near city center and it is only a walk of about 30 min to get to Kings Cross and St Pancras Station. Hosts are very very nice persons. They are warm, friendly and happy to provide plenty of suggestions about travelling around and also glad to help solve guests' personal problems. It is suitable for 1-2 persons to live in. Generally speaking, Hasina's is a very good place to live during the stay in London that I would strongly recommend."

We had a great stay in the larger room of the two; which you can book.

The area is very quiet - a perfect place to relax after a busy day in London.

If you have questions or need anything Janet and her family will always help you."

El desayuno que ofrece Enrico es fantástico! Leche, café y te, varios tipos de cereales, fruta variada y frutos secos. Nos encantó. 
El es un anfitrión excelente y te explica todo muy bien. 
Si necesitas alguna cosa no duda en ayudarte. Ah! Y es el perfecto hombre del tiempo! Hacedle caso antes de salir de casa! ;)

Everything you could possibly need for your stay and such a detailed tourist guide book. In a fantastic area. Cliff was really responsive, will definitely stay there again!! Thank you !"
919261,21474834,18/10/2014,15189871,Jannine,"I stayed at the flat while working in London. It was excellent. Alex is extremely accomdating, friendly, and pleasant. I did not meet Sara, who was away, but she checked in with me during my stay as well. 

The room itself is VERY spacious and well lit. The bed is comfy. There was a place for me to hang my clothes, which was great. Alex provided ear plugs, but I did not find it too noisy at night. 

The location: very close to both the tube and bus stations (1-2 min walk), in the heart of shoreditch. I love the location. It's near many restaurants, shops, and bars. Also close to an organic grocery store, a TESCO, and a Sainsbury's. 

Other pleasant things: 
There was food and tea for breakfast, amenities (e.g., shampoo, soap, mouthwash) in the bathroom, and a power adaptor for guest use. 
Alex took the time to draw me a map of where I had to take the bus to work, which I appreciated. The flat itself is aesthetically pleasing and clean. I felt comfortable working and relaxing in the living room.

I felt at so at home during my stay that I have already booked to stay with Sara and Alex again this upcoming November, when I go back to London for work.

Hiten was really helpful and clear in the information he provided us. The only pain point (literally) was for us the bed where we could actually count each and every springs with our ribbs. A new mattress would definitely be something to consider.

Everything was even better than we expected from the description and pictures; clean, quite, comfortable and a safe neighbourhood. Alex had a lot of tips and suggestions which he gladly shared with us and he was most helpful with practical things as well. Close to busses, tube and Hyde Park, it was quick and easy to get around. There are also a lot of small cafes, shops and restaurants nearby. All in all we had a great time staying in Alex's flat in Kensington! Highly recommended!"

Their cats are adorable (and surprisingly affectionate!) and they are very welcoming and helpful. The flat is in an excellent location, close to South Quay DLR and ten minutes walk from Canary Wharf. The ensuite bedroom had a very comfortable bed and the flat has everything you could need, washer/dryer, wifi etc. There is a Tesco Express and a delicious Lebanese restaurant below the flat and the local amenities are fab.

We stayed at the top-floor apartment. The place was nice,  clean, and cozy just as seen in the pictures. The toilet was a little bit packed with the washing machine and dryer. The kitchen was well equipped, it also had a dishwasher!  It was nice to have the market and a lot of shops at a walking distance. Transportation was convenient with train station about 10 mins away. 
I recommend that if you have a heavy luggage or have difficulty going up stair, you should ask Steve to stay in lower floors."

The house and room are modern and very comfortable - especially the bed! We had our own bathroom with a quiet shower which was great as it didn't disturb anyone if we showered a bit later at night. The room was spacious which was a bonus as we had a fair bit of stuff. Linda kindly allowed us to use her lounge and kitchen as well and left out a breakfast every morning for us. 
I would highly recommend staying with Linda, she is a friendly host and the house is within 15 walking distance to Wimbledon shops/stations or a few minute walk to the bus stop so quite convenient to get around London."

Crouch End has a vibrant High Street with great shops and eateries. There is a park just a few minutes away. A bus stop is conveniently close by.
The actual ‘Shed’ is in a safe, quiet environment at the bottom of Jenny’s garden, it is completely self contained with plenty of space to relax.
The Shed is beautifully furnished, a lot of thought has gone into it with many special touches.
The simple breakfast was much appreciated and fresh fruit in the bowl.
Jenny was on hand to offer advice and provide a warm welcome."

You also have a bust stop right in front of your door. 

This is a perfect studio located in an authentic neighbourhood of central London, with non-tourist places and of course, non-tourist prices.

Nancy's mom met us at the flat when we arrived, and she was just lovely. We had a great time speaking with her and she made us feel right at home! The flat was a dream come true (my boyfriend is a die-hard Gunner) and had everything we needed. We felt so welcome and at home here, and would definitely rent from Nancy again!"

One stop from London Bridge and Borough market - great to get a perfect coffee, fresh fruit and try artisan cheeses, paella gourmet food on way in to city for the day. Sofa bed worked well for teenage son and new fold out bed was great for our 12 yr old daughter. Yuiry was always quick to reply and v helpful.

4627239,24193730,22/12/2014,18401671,Alex,"We had a really nice experience at Victoria's place.  The photos are an accurate representation.  There was ample space and we liked the neighbourhood.  There is a small high street about 100ft from the front door.  And the train (rail and overground) 10mins away.  

We were contacted well before arrival to make arrangements.  We arrived very tired and a little late  to find someone waiting for us at the flat which was great.  There were some basics in the fridge and the heating was on - hooray (having just flown in from the tropics this was key).  A handy instruction booklet was provided and we had sufficient towels pillows, blankets and sheets.  The rooms were ideal for 2 adults and 2 kids.

Everything worked well so we had little reason to contact Victoria.  We were unable to get the TV to work even with terrestrial TV so we relied on the broadband for the kids entertainment.  Unfortunately this stopped working with 2 days left on our trip which left us with communication and entertainment challenges.  We could not resolve this before we left.

Overall a great place to stay and a really nice flat - perfect for our needs.

I should note that the stairs are quite steep and the front door / door lock is a bit sticky which could do with some attention.

9499966,162966217,23/06/2017,16934871,Jessica,This Place was perfect for our 9 days in London. We had two different underground stations we could choose from that could really get us anywhere in London. Plus with is being less than a block away from Hyde Park was ideal. There were pubs just down the street from us and grocery stores and restaurants were very close as well. This place was a lot more spacious than I thought it would be which was awesome! And the washer and dryer were a major plus. We cannot wait to visit London again and stay at Elena's charming flat.

Close to two tube stations and bus stops just around the corner. With that being said- it was on a quiet street and even on ground level I never heard noise.
The studio was represented perfectly in the photos. It has everything you could need for a stay in London- even converters and a hair dryer!
Lastly, Peter was so easy to communicate with, check in couldn't have been easier, and he helped me with bag storage due to my schedule! Amazing stay. Absolutely recommend this studio!"

Plenty of buses literally just around the corner and Forest Hill Station a few hundred metres down the road. We have young kids who loved being able to go to Hornimans Museum and park as it was just over the road. The house itself was great! Very clean and the host was very welcoming and helpful. The back garden also opens up to a private wooded area out the back which is ideal for children to play in. We had a wonderful stay and I highly recommend this place.

In about 15 minutes you are at the Underground Clapham common, in about 8 minutes on the bus (355) to Clapham north, Toothing, Balham ..., or in about 10 minutes at the bus stop Park Hill. From here, take line 35 and 37 directly to Brixton.

The place is beautiful, with great views of London's SE side. Only complaints are that the curtains are broken so getting complete privacy is a hassle. Also, the key lockbox location is a bit strange. Its attached to a public bike rack a block down the street."

Nadaav was attentive, friendly and helpful despite being away in Devon for the weekend, which was particularly impressive considering I booked his place with very little notice - a rarity in a city with a lot of Airbnb management companies.  Good value too, by London standards. Would recommend, and would certainly stay here again."

It’s located in one of the nicest neighborhoods in London.  You can walk almost everywhere. With that said, I feel obligated to say that the apartment is not what you might expect from the photos.  While the front desk and lobby certainly could be described as “Modern”, it ends there.  The actual apartment is much older, smaller, a bit dirtier and slightly more eccentric than we had expected. We felt like we were staying at an 18 year olds college dorm room. Cigarette smoke wafting in from the neighbors, Dirty laundry still sitting in the washing machine, cabinet doors falling off of the hinges oh my!!!  It is obvious that someone lives here, so if you are looking for a romantic getaway you might opt for a hotel. If you plan on seeing the sights and being out and about most of the time, based on the excellent location this could be the flat for you.   "

Besides all that, the neighbourhood is beautiful, nice and peaceful. 
There's a few convenience stores along the road outside preston road station and as we are muslims, there was a quite a handful of halal food places too. The room is as the picture, very clean.

From the moment I reached her home, she was incredibly helpful and hospitable-she helped me carry my very heavy bag up the stairs without asking and then welcomed me into the coziest and absolutely beautifully decorated room with a stunning bathroom steps
Away. She had a heater running to ensure that the temperature was comfortable and the most delicious cake that I devoured shortly thereafter. I felt so pampered staying in such a nice boutique type setup but at the same time felt so cozy and at home. Even though I was on vacation I looked more forward to coming back to her home than actually being out and about! The best icing on the top of this experience was her pets- the cutest and most darling and friendly little creatures who were so lovely to be around and hang out with. If that wasn’t enough, her beautifully presented breakfasts made me feel nourished and got my day off to a healthy and delicious start. Whenever she could, she would take time out of her busy day to have a quick, heartfelt chat. Thank you Mary Beth for making this experience a memorable one, I already cannot wait to come back!!!"

The water stayed hot for 6 people taking showers. We enjoyed the large kitchen and back garden with trampoline. Our kids especially enjoyed caring for their sweet cat. If you’re bringing a car, this is home is fortunately located outside the ULEZ area of London. We were thankful to have a driveway, but be advised it’s small. We have a Mazda CX-9 and it barely fit (and even then, all the passengers had to get out first). But it’s free, and that was most important. The Vietnamese and Indian restaurants down the street were excellent. The neighbors and the park across the street get a bit noisy on the weekends.

One of the best things besides the decoration in the apartment is the amazing day light. The neighborhood was really good, quite at night and full of life at day time. Really close to the Metro station and with a very convenient Bakerloo line that takes you right to the center of London. Thanks Olga!! We will be back for sure!! David, Montse and Dani.

The apartment is in a fantastic, convenient location and our family of 5 was able to sleep comfortably. As I mentioned, though, the wifi was unreliable and slow, which made things difficult. Also, the apartment could have been cleaner (it was a little dusty and there was some clutter in the drawers and cabinets). Overall, however, we enjoyed our stay and our time in London! "

Rekomenderar det verkligen och kommer garanterat boka detta igen om jag återvänder. Brian och Bev var noggranna med att vi alltid var nöjda och hjälptes med glädje åt att ge oss tips om London och hur man lättast skulle ta sig runt. Rummet är super fräscht och du har egen toalett med dusch. Nära att gå till buss som tar dig till tunnelbana. 10 av 10 i allt!!

She was an attentive host and her place was just like staying at a hotel. 
She made sure we were comfortable and she made us feel like we were top priority while we were there. 
Her place is about 5 minutes walking distance to the nearest bus/underground station, and is in a very peaceful neighborhood. 
Erika's place would be a great choice for anyone staying in London, I'll definitely see if she's available the next trip back!

Thank you for the great stay Erika!"

You are the perfect hostess due to your warm and welcoming personality and your many talents.  The house has been decorated to a very high standard, is kept clean and cosy and therefore it's a home away from home.  The bedroom is lovely with lots of storage in a big built-in cupboard.  The shower is adjacent in the bathroom.  It's quiet at night and conveniently located for transport inclusive of Boris bikes or Tescos.  If you need information on what to do, Beth will update you!

Unfortunately we didn't get to interact as much as we would've liked due to a busy schedule, but they were chatty and friendly when we saw them. The room itself is in a sort of self contained area and you have your own bathroom. A short walk to both the tube and buses and some lovely cafes and restaurants around as well. A fantastic experience overall."

590823,82904137,30/06/2016,56052956,Teresa,"This was our first time on London and using airbnb. The pictures are very accurate and what you see if what you get. I don't have a point of comparison but I suspect that the size corresponds to the standards of living in a city like London. We did not meet Francie or any of her assistants. We arrived quite late at night and did our own check-in. The electricity in the flat was turned off and it took us a while to figure out what was the problem and locate the switch; all this while it was pitch black. We had also requested that the daybed be made because I was travelling with a friend and needed separate beds. This was not done and there were no instructions for where to find sheets. Having instructions for how to turn on electricity and where to find bed sheets ahead of time would have been helpful. Otherwise, Francie was quite responsible on email and even called to check to make sure we had arrived okay. It should be noted that the loft bed is not accessible if you have a mobility issue and that the loft space where the bed is is quite low so it might not be good for someone with back issues or claustrophobia. The daybed by the window though is quite comfortable. The best part of this flat is its location: just walking distance to Portobello Market and 2 tube stations. Overall, the stay was pleasant."
21063089,284873454,02/07/2018,78124192,Andrew,"We had a fantastic stay at Olga's place, the room was very clean and tidy, with access to the fridge and kitchen, and our own cupboard full of crockery. TV in the room had Netflix and catch up TV installed, which was a very nice touch, couldn't ask for more! Check in and communication was flawless and prompt, and we were even greeted with an ice cold bottle of water after our arrival on one of the hottest days of the year. Would definitely recommend, and very good value. Many thanks Olga!"

Libby even contacted us the day of and after to make sure everything went well. It’s a great quite neighborhood. We felt very safe during our whole trip. It was nearby the underground station. Libby and Jordan provided detailed information on how to use Appliances, nearby restaurants, and etc. I would strongly recommend Libby and Jordan’s place."

The location is almost perfect, especially if you want to explore East London (which I highly recommend). If you can stay through a Sunday morning, the apartment is only steps away from the most amazing flower market - definitely worth going. The apartment isn't fancy, but it was all we needed for a great week in London.  "

The location was awesome, we all slept great every night, and the washer and dryer were so helpful. While the flat is a little on the smaller side, it didn't bother us because we were always out and about around London!

Wenn wir uns gesehen haben, hatte Raimonda immer Zeit für einen kleinen Chat. Sie war sehr hilfsbereit und zuvorkommend. Sie hat mir sogar angeboten, dass ich mit Ihnen Abendessen kann. Das Zimmer war wie auf den Bildern, kuschelig und gemütlich. Das ganze Haus war sehr gemütlich eingerichtet. Ich habe mich sehr wohl gefühlt. Ich weiß schon, dass wenn ich wieder nach London gehe, werde ich auf jeden Fall bei Raimonda und Paulius wohnen. "

The room is not very large but good enough for a few days, and hey, it's London. At times the house could be too crowded, like other hostels, but if you are lucky, you may have nearly the whole space for yourself. In the end you get what you pay, and location wise, it's certainly a steal."

The apartment is beautifully styled, and the Christmas decorations were gorgeous.  The location, only a minute from the tube, is so convenient and there are a number of smaller supermarkets just around the corner. It is on a lovely street in a beautiful neighbourhood and I was amazed at just how quiet it was at nighttime for sleeping. Thank you Desley for the perfect start to our holiday!"

The bedroom and bath are located on their own floor up two flights of rather narrow winding staircase. Dayse and her family were very welcoming, at the same time allowing me all the privacy I wanted. Special touches included a bowl of fruit on arrival and plenty of clean towels, all very artfully arranged! I loved that I could easily eat breakfast and takeaway meals in the room. I was amazed at how peaceful and restful the room, the house, and the neighbourhood were, even though the location is within easy walking distance to buzzy restaurants, cafés and shops. Since I was on my own, the fact that the double bed abuts the wall on one side didn't bother me, but a couple might prefer a bed they could access from both sides. Anyone allergic to cats might think twice about staying here, but I loved the sweet house cat who visited my room once or twice. "

7289609,607604622,18/02/2020,89877354,Louise,"Communication with both Ghanim and Sarah Jane was positive and response time was excellent. 

We did not use the common areas at all, which we didn't feel comfortable in. There was a strong smell on the ground floor, trash piled up in the kitchen, some worn out furniture, all of which did not create a comfortable atmosphere.
 
Although comfortable, the space we occupied could have been a little more welcoming— most of the lights did not work until the bulbs were changed a few days into our visit and one outlet didn’t work, which an extension corrected; the shower water was not regulated and ran both scorching hot and freezing cold creating an unpleasant and dangerous experience; the bathroom sink is quite inadequate; the roof leaked just outside our bedroom door during a significant rainfall and the wet floor created a potential safety issue.  We placed a pot under the leak and mopped up the floor as well as we could. 
 
In general terms, the property would benefit from some TLC, an upgrade in furniture, significant tidying up in the kitchen, the addition of a user-friendly coffee maker, and a decluttering of the garden—especially the shed, which contents are clearly visible from the ground floor.

The Airbnb is well situated and check-in was very easy thanks to Sarah Jane’s proximity to the property. She graciously showed us around and made herself available to us as needed; she was very responsive and courteous, addressing our concerns in a timely manner. 
 
We would recommend the AirBnB again if these remedies were addressed."

18814666,471321359,17/06/2019,258004345,Gowri,"The support team handling the reservation (ST) messaged me 4 hours before I arrived in London that the cleaner would be delayed due to access issues with the property, and that arrangements were going to be made for the handyman and cleaner to be at the apartment asap, but we wouldn’t be able to check-in at 3pm. I thought it would be a 30 min-1 hour delay so I messaged that it was ok. We got to London and I messaged the ST for a status update. No reply for at least an hour. After multiple calls to the ST, and after being put on hold for nearly 45 mins at a time, we learned from the ST that the previous guests had tampered with the lockbox and we wouldn’t be able to open it and get the key fob? Why wasn’t this settled with the previous guests before our arrival? My family and I were stuck outside in the cold, hungry and tired after a long journey. When we did get the key fob, we tried to access the main door but we couldn’t. Nowhere did it say in the instructions given to us by the ST that we had to tap the key fob on the bottom right of the sensor panel. By some miracle, a resident of the apartment building saw us and let us in with her own fob, and also told us how to tap the fob on the panel. When we tried it with our own fob, it turns out that the fob had run out of battery! This was another level of stress because it meant no one could leave the apartment. We went into the apartment, which HAD NOT BEEN CLEANED. There were beer bottles, food wrappers and rubbish everywhere. The floor was sticky, the furniture had been pushed around, and the rooms were clearly messed-around. Seemed that no arrangements had been even made for the cleaner to come - we had to call the ST ourselves and then only did they say they were arranging for a cleaner to come by. She arrived later on, but was waiting outside the building for 40 mins in the cold, but we had no way of identifying her because the ST refused to pass us any contact details. It was past 7pm and the cleaner still agreed to clean our entire flat and even buy us additional household supplies that were not even provided. When I enquired to the ST about getting a set of working keys, we had to wait nearly for 2 hours for someone to drive by and pass the new set of keys to the cleaner - only she was allowed to take the keys. When I asked if this new set would work, the ST was doubtful about that. So for the entirety of our stay, we were worried that the keys would suddenly run out of battery. There were so many conflicting instructions and incidents that happened during the first night we were here that this is the short story. Also: this apartment CANNOT BE LOCKED FROM THE OUTSIDE. The metal keys do not work on ANYTHING. Every time we left the house on the three nights we were there, we took a huge risk, because our luggage was inside an unlocked apartment. Even if one of us wanted to stay in and safeguard the luggage, we wouldn’t be safe. This is extremely dangerous and I hope something is done about this. The large windows in both bedrooms couldn’t be closed, so we were bitten by mosquitoes. There's no bulb fixture in the large living room lamp, so it doesn't work. There is no hand-held showerhead in the bathrooms. There was food in the freezer that must have been there for ages by the smell of it. Our trip would have been perfect if not for these major issues hanging over our heads: the lack of transparent communication, the lack of consideration for incoming guests, and the lack of basic security measures.  Otherwise, the location was perfect, kitchen was well-equipped and the space generally was homely and comfortable."

There is a written manual that describes everything about the neighborhood. However, we did find the neighborhood to be extremely loud and the walls of the apartment echoed everything from the outside and from the other neighbors. We were constantly been awoken by people talking outside, and neighbors throwing board game parties. The only quiet time we managed to get was about 3 hours from 3am-6am. I would definitely give the apartment itself a 5 star rating for being very homely and nice, but the constant noise was really annoying to deal with."

Chris was good at getting in touch prior to the weekend, and was flexible with check in and check out times, which I really appreciated.

I was greeted by a nice note and bottle of wine, which was much appreciated!  

The house was beautiful - the lounge and dining room perfect for entertaining in, and the bedrooms all good sized and with very comfy beds. If you have a young child, then there's also a room with a cot. The garden was lovely, and we were delighted to find a gas BBQ! The kitchen was well equipped and a good size, with a table big enough for a few people to sit around. A lovely house to relax and entertain in.

The local area is well known to me, and is the perfect example of south London genteel suburbia - tree-filled streets, beautiful parks (Peckham Common is 15 mins walk and Dulwich Park is about 20), lots of boutique shops and nice places to eat. 

I'd highly recommend staying at Chris and his family's beautiful home, and have very happy memories of my 30th because of it. "

We were allowed a bit earlier drop off for our luggage while the flat was cleaned and refreshed from earlier visitors,when we returned 2 hours later all was very tidy and ready for us- we appreciated the full-size fridge, and eat-in area, great proximity to the supermarket. The train going by was a bit noisy with the windows open, but at night we closed windows on that side, and it was really very quiet. Nice large bathroom, and lots of room for 3 of us (one person used the airbed, which is very comfortable. Good value for the price/location."

Two complaints: 1.) it was never stated in the description that the apartment is located on the 4th floor and there’s no elevator. 2.) the owner and his friend were loud all 3 nights I was there. I understand that this is a shared apartment, which is fine. However, I’ve stayed in other shared Airbnb’s before and the owners were not that loud."

756481,9828995,13/01/2014,6142706,Selma,"We've stayed for two nights in studio nr. 15 in January 2014. It's a very nice and clean studio. For just a few nights it's perfect. If you want to stay longer, I would not recommend this particular studio because it's a bit small. Also the bed is a bit small.

You're sharing the bathroom with one other apartment on the same floor. There is a toilet in the bathroom and a separate toilet on the corridor. Although we've stayed in London in January, the weather was very mild. I don't know if that had anything to do with it, but the apartment was very hot, so we slept with the window open. The kitchen is fully equipped but we missed a tea towel or hand towel, those would have been useful. We're from The Netherlands so we have different power outlets and we forgot to bring an international plug. Carol (the house keeper) was very helpful and luckily she had one for us.

What's great about this place, is the location. It takes about five minutes to walk to Victoria station. From there you can get to all the hot spots in less than 15 minutes by tube. You can easily walk to Buckingham Palace. For a nearby dinner or drink, we recommend The Queens Arms on Warwick Way. The fish and (homemade) chips were very good. You'll find a large supermarket (Sainsbury's market) on your way to Victoria station on Wilton Road.

Alltogether we had a very pleasant stay at Allesandro's studio and there's a big chance we'll stay there again when we're visiting London."

There is a bus stop right in front of the house but since the tube station was so close we just walked straight there.  The house is in a safe area.

Annamaria's flat is very sunny and clean and it has been recently refurbished. The bedroom is pretty, and the bed has a memory foam mattress, which was very appreciated by my mother. Annamaria is a very pleasant host as is her gorgeous son Ruben: my family where very happy to have a chat with them during breakfast or when they got home in the evenings. Furthermore, Annamaria gave them/us precious tips (both transport-wise and food-wise) and my brother especially enjoyed taking part in one of her classes at the gym. Overall I am very thankful to Annamaria for being such a great host and for having been so welcoming towards my mum and my brother who had never tried airbnb and had a great experience. I definitely recommend Annamaria's accomodation!"

Nous connaissions déjà Londres, et cet appartement est idéalement situé, nous avons pu repasser par « chez nous » plusieurs fois au cours de nos journées, ce qui est très appréciable. Une seule chose m’a manqué : un grand miroir ;) (et quand il ne manque que ça, c’est que vraiment tout va bien !). Merci, nous reviendrons avec plaisir !"

In a cool and easygoing manner, Martin makes you feel at home in his refined and cosy cocoon. Polyglot, open-minded and always eager to help, Martin is a friendly and caring host. I enjoyed the large and comfortable bed as well as the private bathroom.  Overall, a great place to drop in and stay over feeling like a special guest."

The room is really nice and the breakfast she offered us, as well. Neighbourhood is good and the next Bus and Underground Station are not far from the House.

25020748,284340207,01/07/2018,9534666,Jason,"Are you looking for a flat that isn’t in Central London but has easy and direct public transport options to get you there?  Looking for a quiet place with all of the amenities of your home?  Value for money?  Fast Wi-Fi?  Well, you’ve found it!

The flat is located within walking distance of Manor House & Finsbury Park Tube stations. Bus access via the 253 & 254 lines is less than a minute walk away.  There’s a nearby Poundland for inexpensive toiletries and a Sainsbury’s for your groceries.  The flat doesn’t have air conditioning or a fan but, I didn’t need it during my stay. You get excellent cross-ventilation from the large window in the living room and bedroom making the recent heat wave a non factor.

Veronica and her team are very communicative making check-in and check-out a breeze. The flat was very clean and is well represented by the photos in the advert. It’s an upstairs flat but only one flight up. You really can’t go wrong with this place. I highly recommend this flat for the convenience of being in London without being stuck in the madhouse that is Central (tourist) London."

Bathrooms were clean and spacious. Kitchen was very small, but contained all needed supplies. The rooms were adequate in size and clean. The beds in all of the rooms were very uncomfortable. Ikea quality beds. No a/c or fans available, so the upstairs rooms were quite warm unless windows were left open. Overall, good house for the price!"

446900,38986440,20/07/2015,26665778,Stéphanie,"Carmen's appartment is very clean, quiet and looks as shown on the pictures. There is enough room to accomodate 8 people and there is a large kitchen/living room. The kitchen contains everything that one might need. There are also 2 lovely terrases protected from the wind. The appartment is so arranged that no one is disturbing the others when moving inside. It is located at the 8th and 9th floor of a clean and new building located on an area with several other new buildings. There is no traffic between these. This makes the immediate area very quiet (and it is safe too). There are also several place to eat just down the building.

The location is very interesting. The surrounding area does not seem to be specially interesting. There are several super/mini markets just nearby. The transportation possiblities are just incredible : overgrounds and buses, just at the corner, allow you to move accross London either rapidly (by over/underground) or by bus (in more scenic way). From Dalston Junction to Green Park, throught Picadilly, seating on the top of the bus 38 is indeed a quite nice journey  !

Althought we didn't met Carmen, everything went smoothly with quick answers to our questions : from getting the keys at the Concierge to departure. We had a great stay at Carmen's appartment.

I strongly recommend Carmen's place and I'll come back there with my family next time.

L'appartement était conforme à la description et à notre attente. Tout était propre , bien rangé et avec toutes les commodités.
L'arrivée se fait en autonome en récupérant les clés dans une boite sécurisée, aucun soucis.
Coté salon/cuisine l'appartement est calme mais coté chambres c'est bruyant du fait que les fenêtres sont d'époque et aucune isolation phonique , ni thermique. Cela peut être dérangeant.
Un double vitrage ou un remplacent des fenêtre serait un plus indéniable.
A part ce point , nous ne regrettons pas notre choix pour une visite de Londres.
Le propriétaire nous a toujours répondu rapidement et avec beaucoup de gentillesse."

The room has a large, comfortable bed, and has doors opening out onto a pretty, bird-filled garden. My host, Neel was friendly, making me a cup of tea soon after my arrival, and he provided me with a large bottle of drinking water. He was very accommodating in my being able to leave luggage there for a while the day I left. Apart from some slight cleanliness issues (the floors and bathroom weren't spotless, and the kitchen was in slight disarray), this was a good, comfortable stay."

To get into bed you need to climb wooden bunk bed ladders but the bed is much more comfortable than I was expecting. The room was warm and it was very quiet on an evening which was brilliant, as usually when I stay in London I find it very noisy. Due to my work patterns I didn’t see much of Matthew but when I did, he was very easy to talk to and knowledgeable of the area and London. Overall a great find and brilliant host."

9769063,93723283,13/08/2016,9560255,Sylvia,"Lots of pros and some cons: the location was convenient (right near Exmouth Market, good bus service and access to various tube stations), but the traffic on Farringdon was quite audible at all times.  This is a corporate listing, not someone's private flat, so I expected a higher level of amenities.  The flat itself was as advertised, colorful and fairly spacious, but all the furniture -- including ""upholstered"" chairs -- was washable, which is not particularly comfortable; and although everything seemed fairly new, the sofa sagged and one side of the bed even more so.  Only one closet (in the bedroom) with two hanging rods meant one couldn't really hang up a coat or dress; there was no place to store a suitcase.  The bathtub was nice and deep, but without a hold bar it was awkward and slippery getting in and out.  Heated towel bar was a nice touch, but without any electric outlet in the bathroom and none near any mirror in the flat, hair drying/styling was awkward.  The bathroom has only one inadequate shelf for toiletries, etc.  The kitchen had a full set of dishes, utensils, and cooking equipment, but there was no bowl adequate for cereal in the morning.  Housekeeping service was excellent, but I asked the management the first day to have the many burnt-out light bulbs replaced and that never happened.  Internet service was fine.  I was happy enough staying for a month, but I'll look for another place next year."

Lets start with the great access to public transportation. The building doesn't look like much from the outside but Mike's Apartment is perfect to serve as a home base for a trip to London. My wife and I were traveling with our 8-month old daughter. The only issue we had the entire time is that we had to walk up and down the stairs with the stroller and our things twice a day. The apartment is right near Earl's Court tube station and most importantly, especially if you're traveling with young ones, there's a 24 hour Tesco's RIGHT AROUND THE CORNER. This was huge. Mike's kitchen has everything you would need to stay in a make a nice dinner if you wanted. The apartment has a fireplace, which we used frequently when we were winding down at night. There are two bedrooms and two bathrooms and a roof desk which we didn't use too much because of the temperature, but cool regardless. Mike was incredibly friendly and was understanding when it took us an inconceivable three hours to get from Gatwick to the apartment to check in. This was our first time in London and I really couldn't imagine having had a better AirBNB experience. Thanks again Mike! "

Clean place. But I have to say that it was very noisy at night (can't blame the host) and so it's not for those who prefer quieter surroundings. Also, got very hot and it's also not for those visiting in summer. While there was a fan in one room, the other room was practically uninhabitable. Also the apartment ought to have been better priced. I've paid similar prices for better apartments in better locations.

15911207,486879863,13/07/2019,30983380,Rizlan,The place is very well situated and relatively large. Two  bedroom and a large living room/kitchen. Internet is fine. It is extremely convenient. We were able to do some basic cooking. The furniture  is minimalistic but functional.  We had everything we needed. The only downside is the cleanliness. The washing machine had some growth in it and the dish drying rack was dirty and most of the faucets had deposits (calcium carbonate). I recommend this place  overall. We had a wonderful time. It  is perfect for a  family  of 4 with young-ish kids (ours were 8 and 11).
18834768,528142796,12/09/2019,19246680,Anne,Marta and Eric’s house is on the main road close to North Sheen station which was very convenient. They are a super family and lovely hosts. We enjoyed our stay in their beautiful loft flat immensely. We visited Richmond and Kew Gardens - both within walking distance. The whole area is in the flight path for Heathrow so it can be noisy from the planes sometimes during the day but it didn’t bother us! We would definitely stay there again should we have another visit - there are so many things to do in the area.

Woke to owls hooting and yet only a few minutes walk to Highgate tube and the cafe societies of Highgate, Muswell Hill and Crouch End.

A really great AirBnB which I’d  highly recommend to people wanting to stay in this part of North London."

Some cute wall art too. Very satisfied!"

The floors are a bit creaky and it’s a bit noisy at night with being close to the street. The fire alarm also went off at 2am one night and we had to wait outside until the fire department turned off the alarm. Otherwise, a super great place!"

If you’re older and want to have a good nights sleep, I wouldn’t pick this one. Both nights I was there the nightclub downstairs was pounding music and I could hear and feel it under my head until 2am both nights. The bathroom was very dirty and smelled horrible, didn’t look like it was properly cleaned everyday. The pod was fine, but the pods up top are way over heated it felt like 35 degrees! Wish I had a better review."

Or if you prefer walking around, a lot of tourist stops like Big Ben, London tower, British museum, London bridge etc are all within an hour’s walk. James is also easy going and great company!

34491569,740929734,21/03/2021,20133946,Ariel,"This place was a great value for money, especially in London, and especially during covid. As previously reviews mentioned, there is the occasional train passing by but honestly for us it was soothing as it's not very loud and it's easy to get used to. Also as previous reviews mentioned, the place seemed like it had been a while since it was cleaned, so we rewashed things like the dishes and the bedding before settling in. A lot of the furniture seems to be on its last leg/almost breaking down.

But other than those things, it was in a great location, especially with all the grocery stores right down the street. Gerard responded quickly and fixed any problems that arose (the oven/hob was replaced while we were there so it's brand new now). It was definitely the most affordable place we could find and it was nice having two rooms in central London. The heating was perfect and the place was always warm. The wifi works but doesn't quite reach both rooms and is sometimes slow. All the appliances--tv, washer, microwave--worked great.

Would definitely stay here again"

It's very well located, sparkling clean, and the family is very friendly. The music room is full of beautiful instruments and as such there isn't a huge amount of space for stuff, but that wasn't a big issue for me. It's also ideal for visitors who will be out during the day, either working or sightseeing, as it is a family home after all! Thank you for a wonderful stay."

Beautiful area with a lovely deli and local restaurants literally a minute away. We loved the outside space and swing chair in the garden and all the lovely touches in the flat like great lighting (in the garden too) which made the flat really lovely and relaxing. Gadi and Gilli were really available and helpful via (Hidden by Airbnb) and although this was there home it also felt very like our own space as the flat is so beautifully uncluttered.

4391488,72836706,04/05/2016,52075461,Vasudha,"The location of Oleg's apartment is indeed  very central, walking distance to a tube station. However his description of the house gave out incorrect information. It said and I quote - 

'The flat is on the first floor without a lift. There are about 14 steps. And the room is upstairs so there are some more steps to climb. I will be happy to help you with suitcases.'

It is right that the apartment is without a lift, but his flat is on the 4th Floor! I was travelling with my parent who is over 60 yrs, and so I was keen to live in an apartment which either had a lift or didn't have much of a climb (1 floor was ideal, as he had mentioned in his description). But to my utter dismay, I realised the Oleg had provided us with wrong information, we had to climb up 4 floors with heavy suitcase, he left before my arrival so I did not receive any help in carrying the suitcases, I had to take the back entrance to his apartment which added another floor to be climbed up. I had mentioned it to him in our correspondence that I would be travelling with an older person, but he did not care to mention this important fact to me at any point.

This according to me, was rather unprofessional. 

Other than this, his place is rather clean and cosy. Its a bit smaller than it looks in the pictures but comfortable for two people.

The hosts are friendly and ready to offer advice on how to traverse the city if you're in need of guidance. Highly recommend.
26860167,293517387,20/07/2018,46846513,Alex,"Jeremy’s apartment was one of the coolest/most unique apartments that I’ve ever rented. The location is great, in a safe building, and close to public transportation options to get you all over London.

He was there to greet me and give me the rundown of the apartment, public transport options, and things to do in the surrounding area. 

I would highly recommend his place for anyone looking for a cool experience while in London. "

The house was exactly as advertised. The room was quiet, clean, and inviting – there were even tea and coffee available in our room, and shower supplies available in the bathroom! 

As Rosh writes in her bio, they have two small dogs. They were as quiet as church mice and any non-dog fans certainly shouldn’t be put off by them.

 Rosh and her family are truly wonderful hosts. We highly recommend that you stay with them if your travels take you to London.

Leur maison, très cosy, est située dans un quartier calme, en étant en plein cœur de Londres. Nous avons donc pu profiter des quartiers incontournables, à pied.

From there connections to train stations to anywhere in London is easy. You could also just stay in Chiswick as there are pubs, shops and restaurants on Chiswick High Road which the E3 bus travels down. The Thames is nearby (about a 20 minute walk down a paved path) with with pubs and restaurants as well. The accommodations were quiet, clean and comfortable. I would definitely stay here again.

40085056,574418470,08/12/2019,34820186,Polina,"Superb location! The building is in a safe and quiet cul-de-sac, less than 10 minutes walk from Gloucester Road Station, less than 15 minutes walk from Earl’s Court Station.  Lots of great restaurants, grocery stores, etc. nearby.  

The apartment is on the fourth floor, no elevator in the building. Please keep that in mind if you have many or heavy luggage bags. 

The studio is very small, which I guess is common for central London.  Bed is luxurious and very comfortable.  Working washer and dryer in the room.    Tiny kitchen with a stovetop, microwave, sink, nice dishes, utensils, and some cooking pans. Very thoughtful.  The shower was tiny, even for a small person like me.  Water pressure was good and temperature is easily adjustable.  

The heater in the studio stopped working in the middle of my stay and it took a few days to fix the heating situation. The  host kindly agreed to extend my stay by one night for free to compensate for the inconvenience, which I greatly appreciated."
402739,7663299,29/09/2013,5032220,Olivia,"I stayed at Tessa's for a few weeks. Although the room is not big, it was for me the perfect place to stay: central, quiet, non smoking and clean. Tessa is great, she will ALWAYS find a solution to your problem, or an answer to your question. Cherry on the cake: she is a very interesting person. To make it short, I just loved her and her place. :-*. 
So you please go to her place, ok, but do leave it free for when I'll have to go back ;-). All the best and enjoy your stay!"

14387549,322813652,14/09/2018,93105042,Emma,Vesna and Michael's home is a small B&B which offers very good value for money and is ideal for a short stay.  It's about a 10 min walk from West Action station but really easy to find and area feels very safe.  Room was sparkling clean and bed extremely comfortable.  Plenty of options for breakfast and a very clean kitchen with nice quiet aspect onto garden.  Good facilities with a downstairs toilet and upstairs bathroom.  There was a little bit of noise from the comings and goings in the evening and the morning mainly due to the hard floors.  Having a lock on the door was great as a lone female traveller.  I would definitely recommend and would happily stay here again.
6454057,578298488,17/12/2019,51941285,Dave,"Had a super chill and easygoing experience at Marco's and Stefano's house. It was just as described and a nice and warm place to recover from a day in the (hectic) city. The room had everything that you would need, including a comfy bed, a nice big mirror, a hair dryer, a TV and a big wardrobe. Conveniently located directly on the central line, which took us to Liverpool St. Station/Bank/Tottemham Ct in about 35mins. The walk to the underground station East Acton was about 5mins. The ride home was perfect for a nice breather before jumping into bed. Although located near the A40 it didn't bother us much once in the house/room because it was comfortable and quiet enough to take it easy and sleep well. Marco's and Stefano were great hosts, answered all our questions super fast and even left us some nice treats every other day. Very considerate. :) If you want a cheap stay to sleep, that's easy going and super conveniently located, look no further and book this place! We would gladly stay here again. Thank you for everything! Cheers!"

The place itself is very cozy and James was very hospitable, providing breakfast options, tea and coffee, and travel books. The only issue we ran into was with the location itself, in that people in the building can be loud at night and the walls are a little thin."

Mike welcomed me to his home like a friend and even invited me to join his early Christmas dinner - seriously this guy rocks :) in summary a well priced, clean, warm, friendly flat you can make a home which was a haven in London for me.

Le concept est plutôt sympa, la maison entière a été divisée en studios... Par contre coté isolation, on entend tout ce qui se passe dans le bâtiment, mais par chance nos voisins étaient peu bruyant... Si vous avez le sommeil léger, notez toutefois qu'un couloir aérien doit passer juste au dessus du quartier, beaucoup d'avions... Personnellement après nos longues journées de visites cela ne nous a pas dérangé... La déco est telle que sur les photos, RAS, petit bémol, l'oubli de papier toilette par la femme de ménage qui ne parle pas un mot d'anglais... Mais pour le tarif, allez-y les yeux fermés, à Londres tout est tellement cher qu'on ne peut pas espérer mieux à ce prix là..."

We were 3 people traveling together ( a couple and a single) and the 2 bedrooms and 2 baths were comfortable and private.  Andrew arranged to have Elena greet us and she graciously filled us in on details of the flat and gave several suggestions for local cafes, pubs and transportation. 
     We loved the Islington area with neighborhood grocery stores, pubs and parks nearby.  It was a  safe and pleasant to walk to Newington Green and easy to take the 73 bus to Kings Cross and beyond.  We found the Canonbury Overground Station nearby and it was also convenient.  
     Andrew left us a lovely selection of fruit, yogurt and breads, plus excellent butter and jam.  What could be better!  We woke up to views of the leafy green garden and blossoming trees.  
     There are a few stairs and they were not a problem for us.  I would say that you would be very fortunate to stay at Andrew’s flat.  We had a fantastic time  in London!"

The problem with the place  (mainly bathrooms and kitchen) is that the one-a-week fair cleaning is not enough to host 3-4 people (which is the capacity).

Furthermore, the boiler kept failing , most bulbs do not work, windows do not close well, the house really need deep maintenance."

17734132,322444910,13/09/2018,102368193,Morgane,"We stayed at Ori's and Lou's house for a couple of days; we were only two people. It was an awesome stay!

The flat is really in a perfect location, with everything you need and didn't know you needed just a few steps away! You only have to walk five minutes to be at Covent Garden, and around 10-15 minutes to be at Piccadilly Circus. There are a lot of restaurants for all tastes and budgets close by, so you won't have to walk an hour to find someplace to eat. It is also an ideal location if you like musicals, as theaters are all close.
The closest tube station (Covent Garden) is only a few minutes' walk away, and there are also a few bus stops close by.

Ori was there to greet us when we arrived, even if we were a little late, and showed us around the flat, answered our questions.
You'll find everything you need in the flat: shampoo, soap, hairdryer... even reading glasses!

The flat in itself is beautiful and big. The beds were very comfortable and when you close the windows, it is very quiet in the rooms. Plenty of space for your clothes too, if you're not a light packer :) If you'd rather cook than eat in restaurants, the kitchen is huge, and you'll find a very big dining table. Everything was really clean.

The only problem we had was with the wifi, which sometimes turned off and came back online only a few minutes later. It wasn't that big of a problem for us, as we didn't spend that much time inside, but it could be if you're there for work, so I thought it worth mentioning.

All in all, we spent a great few days in the middle of London!"

Positiv ist die Anbindung mit öffentlichen Verkehrsmitteln nach London City - ein kurzer  Fussmarsch, 1 Station mit der s-bahn und schon ist man am der Victoria-Station,  einem wichtigen Knotenpunkt der City.  In der Nähe findet man alles,  was man braucht (Supermärkte,  Kaffees,  Restaurants,  eine kleine Fußgängerzone etc.)! Das Appartment hat Sarah noch kurz vor unserer Ankunft vorbereiten lassen mit frischer Bettwäsche etc., und während ganzen Zeit stand sie ganz toll pperemail für alle Fragen zur Verfügung.  Internet gab's auch,  Ausstattung also gut (sogar ein Garten da, den wir aufgrund des Wetters (November) nicht nutzen konnten. Ergo: teuer sind die Unterkünfte in London schon;  evtl. gäbe es auch ein wenig günstigere Wohnungen, aber das Gefühl,  nach einem langen Tag in der Stadt nach hause zu kommen War das Geld letztlich wert."

Yet the street is surprisingly quiet. The beds are comfortable, wifi is excellent and the shower is great. Kitchen isn't really sufficient if you plan on doing some real cooking. Closets and  cabinets mostly full with owner's belongings. There is some mold in the kitchen, which I hope will be fixed shortly. James was availae to all our queries in no time.

We did have some hiccups with the television but I'm pretty sure that was due to the satellite and not the actual tv itself.  I would recommend the flat to any one who is looking for a cozy place to stay close to London!

Estuvimos 4 dias, una familia de 9 personas y nos sentimos muy cómodos, como en casa. Disfrutamos mucho la cama elástica. Es un barrio residencial muy tranquilo, pero a la vez con fácil acceso al centro de Londres, en 5 minutos estás en la estación que te lleva a Victoria en otros 15 o 20, facilísimo. Y el proceso de entrada y salida también es muy cómodo, recoges la llave marcando un código de acceso y la vuelves a dejar en el mismo sitio. No conocimos a Jon y Harry, pero se preocuparon de que todo estuviera bien. Si volviera a Londres volvería a reservar con ellos, muy buen precio para la calidad de la casa y el emplazamiento.

It is very well suited for families and located closely to an underground station which can take you to central London pretty fast. There are also nice places to eat close by.

I didn't meet Sam as he was away but Sam' flat mate Luke was most helpful. I would certainly recommend this AirBnb and will most certainly book again when I'm in the area. If I was being picky, it would have been nice to have access to some tea/coffee/milk and even some breakfast items like some other AirBnbs I've stayed in but there is a Sainsbury's downstairs.

The house was beautiful, immaculate and full of nice little details that went way beyond of what you would expect (a card, a box of chocolates, a basquet of fruit, oyster cards, plug adaptors for non-UK guests etc.). The house in itself is really nice, has a lot of light and is decorated with very much taste. During our stay we had a couple of questions and Andrea answered really quickly and generously, as she did during the booking process. We honestly couldn't have asked for more. The neighbourhood has everything you need: street markets where to buy fresh fruit and vegs at good prices, parks and green, river, good transport communications, a gym three minutes away, etc. Part of our great experience of London was Andrea's home, so many thanks again for everything!

It was my first time using Airbnb so I was fortunate that my experience was such a positive one. I was able to do my own thing yet also to share the common spaces with Tasneem and Simon from time to time.

I discovered the 326 bus stops were at the bottom of Laurel Way which saved me some long walks in the hot sun and made it a lot easier to go in and out.

It was helpful to have some breakfast items available which I was able to supplement myself after a visit to the grocery.

Everything worked well and the double bed was awesome as well as the powerful shower.  It is a very peaceful place and I got some great sleep!

Overall I was made to feel welcome and am grateful for this experience."

Although we never got to meet her, she made sure our check in went smoothly and always made herself readily available if we needed her. The room is just like the pictures, very small but very clean and modern. The heating is excellent and the bed is super comfy! It is also very close to the Hammersmith underground which makes it great for travelling anywhere in London, lots of good places to eat near by too. I would definitely recommend Anetta's place to anyone visiting London!"

The room itself is nice, the house very clean and nicely made up and the distance to the next tube station is short enough.

21709109,356482075,08/12/2018,4994834,Katie,"These apartments are very central and I appreciated having a full kitchen - including a washing machine. The bed was clean and comfortable and I appreciated having access to a pull out couch with extra linens if need be. Housekeeping was on hand to clean up every day as well and the front desk staff was friendly and helpful both times I interacted with them. That being said, our apartment smelled pretty strongly of stale cigarette smoke, the handheld shower head did not stay mounted and the windows did not lock. This last thing was a big concern for me and I wish I’d said something about it before. Overall I would recommend the apartment to someone who isn’t overly fancy and is mostly focused on the incredibly convenient location."

The closest tube station is 20 minutes away, but there is a train station close by ( Oyster card Works with trains) and a bus station that allows you to go to the center. Getting to the center is very easy and quite fast. There are big beautiful parks nearby as well. We had a lovely stay! Perhaps the best thing of the apartment are the owners - Sean was always available for any information and tips about the neighborhood! Thank you Sean!"

La pièce de vie, salon + cuisine est un peu petite et il faut s'organise le soir mais c'est suffisant pour une semaine.
L'appartement était propre, bien rangé, les serviettes et draps étaient  place, ainsi que du savon et du shampoing.
Je recommande cet appartement."

But would recommend!"

We will absolutely be back to stay again on our next trip to London, the location was absolutely perfect for us. Because we were 2 people and would like to stay longer next time, we would maybe book a larger flat in the same building. The check in process was a breeze, the flat was clean and had everything we needed. Thank you, Alessandro and your staff! Can't wait to come back :)"

The noise in the second bedrooms was louder than expected. But overall the location and size of the apartment could not be better! Emily was really helpful in organising early check in after a long flight too.

Die Wohnung liegt im Kellerbereich. Morgens scheint die Sonne in die Wohnung, ab Mittag ist sie durch die Lage allerdings recht dunkel. Uns hat das nicht gestört, da wir eh den ganzen Tag unterwegs waren. Die kleine Pantry-Küche mit ihren zwei Herdplatten bietet die Möglichkeit, sich eine Kleinigkeit zum Essen zuzubereiten.  Kleiner Tipp: Küchenhandtücher mitnehmen! 

Die Kommunikation mit Ali war prima und schnell. Danke auch dafür!"
7378630,462473287,02/06/2019,88783312,John,"We had the pleasure of staying at Nick’s house for a week. It was absolutely perfect for a family of 4 or more. My wife and I had a private master bedroom with an en suite and there’s another full bathroom for the kids to use. We were able to do our laundry as well. There’s no dryer but the clothes were easy to dry on the lower level with the fans provided. It’s located on a quiet side street in a nice neighborhood. It was a short walk to the Angel tube stop on the Northern Line with easy changes to other trains at multiple stops. If you’re out late it’s easy to get an Uber to bring you home. It was very easy to get to all the major attractions. We got the Tube Map app which made getting around a snap. The house was very clean with lots of amenities. It was a short walk to a nice grocery store to stock up for the week. Overall we definitely give this house 5 stars. If you are bringing your family to London for vacation, we definitely recommend staying here!"

They were friendly and gracious, their flat was spacious, clean and well-appointed. They provided tips on places to eat, transit options in London and had a binder of information on all the key elements of the flat, building and surrounding areas. It was a wonderful beginning to a magical eight days in London at the start of the Christmas period. 
We were as pleased with our accommodations at the end of the visit as we had been when we arrived. Having travelled often with members of our family to many parts of the world, we appreciate how critical comfortable  accommodations can be to the enjoyment of a trip.  We would highly recommend this to any family or group planning an extended stay in London."

I came for both work and vacation and it's central location made it easily accessible to the Tube and a short walk from the restaurants, shopping, theaters, and pubs of Covent Garden and SoHo.  The flat is cozy, well-appointed, and perfect for a single or couple. "

We went to the Fireworks Display and Bierfest and the property was just a short stroll back. Our room was wonderfully spacious and clean and the bathroom was huge and equally spotless. Simone was so friendly and welcoming. Her house is beautiful and has the perfect setup for guests. We had a tasty breakfast and lovely chat with Simone (for over an hour) whilst her friendly cats came to say hello. We would definitely stay again."

Annalisa was a great host, and even provided breakfast items for our use.  Check-in and check-out was easy and exactly like Annalisa described (i.e. no last minute changes/surprises).  Lots of smaller grocery stores in the area, great fish and chips shop as well.  A great base camp for your London travels!"

The location was great...on a quiet side street near a main street full of restaurants, pubs, groceries, etc.  Easy access to public transportation.  The house was a perfect ""home base"" for exploring London.  When we would get back each night, we could just relax in the living room or have a late snack in the kitchen.  The bedrooms provided everyone with their own separate space (each on its own level).  We would definitely come back on our next visit to London."

We loved the flat in every respect and wished we had been able to stay longer.  My wife and I were traveling together so the space was more than plentiful.  The outdoor patio are was right on time and the weather was perfect.  Everything worked in the flat and it was all was clean and tidy.  Shops, restaurants and everything you might need is nearby.  It is close to bus stops and the Parsons green tube station as well.  Highly recommend."

430227,27796209,12/03/2015,3997972,Jason,"The flat was exactly as advertised and a wonderful place to spend our time in London.

Steve and Judith were excellent hosts. They were very helpful when we had questions or small issues with the flat (a janky doorknob was fixed the same hour we brought it up), but were also wonderful about allowing us our privacy.

The wifi was fast and reliable, the kitchen and bathroom were both fully equipped and clean/in good repair, and the bed was comfortable. There was even a weekly cleaning service (we stayed for a month).

Dalston is a very hip neighborhood with a lot of great coffee shops for working (Tina We Salute You, L'Atelier, and The Laundry were three of our most frequent working spots), some great restaurants (Tonkotsu East, White Rabbit), and even a great cocktail bar (High Water — held up to my snobby cocktail standards).

It's walking distance (~30 minutes) from Shoreditch. There are two Overground stations and a host of bus routes less than five minutes away. It was *extremely* easy to get around from Steve's flat.

This is definitely a place I would rent again."

The room was spacious, clean and you could see some trees from the window. The area was looking safe and there was a sweet park just in the end of the street. The tube station was 10-15 minutes walk and several bus stations were around. A tesco super market was also across the street. There were train rails very close to the house, but surprisingly there was no much noise.... I don't even know if the train passes after midnight.. It never woke me up... The Wifi signal was poor in the room, but they will probably fix it..  
Overall it is a really great BnB, it's comfortable, in a good area, it has its own private bathroom and the family is lovely ! If you like to stay in this side of London, just stay at this BnB without any second thoughts !"

It's a little bit far from downtown London but it's reasonable considering the rental price. public transportation with Uber is a good choice if you are not in a rush schedule."
1208459,143512013,12/04/2017,73806792,Noël,"A truly great spot for a traveler on a budget. It is exactly as seen in the pictures. Very small but all you need if you won't be inside much. A 5-15 minute walk from many major sites with many, many restaurants, theaters, and tourist destination nearby. There were only two negatives - no washer as described and it smelled very strongly of bleach - but they were more of an inconvenience and not real issues. Allen was easy to communicate with and provided helpful tips. If you stay here definitely go to Four Season and try the roasted duck. Incredible!"
8204435,438265568,16/04/2019,69391616,Ana,"This house is really well located! It is easy to get anywhere! The neighborhood is quiet and friendly. The space is modern, really nice."

The only issue was internet speed that I hope they improve it, but overall I had a great stay and recommend it."

23406454,285344646,03/07/2018,145880487,Tamisha,This is a wonderful place to help get acquainted to London.  The central location and closeness to the Shard helped us navigate through our first visit to the city.  The flat with the breathtaking views was more than we expected.  The pictures do not do this lovely place justice.

4015244,91965244,07/08/2016,83256864,Steve,We had a very special stay in this flat. It is perfectly situated in the heart of Covent Garden and even though we live in London it was a treat waking up on Sunday morning having this normally busy area pretty much to ourselves.  We swam in the open air swimming pool which is 100 metres away and enjoyed walking to soho and the South Bank.  The flat was on the 3rd floor which gave us some good views and was comfortable and had everything we needed for our stay.

2213671,185997632,23/08/2017,11094156,Pascal,The house is super nice and super social. Everybody is really friendly and easy going. Tbe neighborhood is very cool. I guess it's the only place in London where you see graffiti and stickers. The walk to the tube station Stratford takes like 15-20minutes. It has a beautiful part: the Olympic park. You can even go swimming in the aquatic centre there. Tube connection is really good. Even in the night. Can't write anything I disliked so I don't.

22623285,303485465,07/08/2018,60052343,Heather,"Loved this Airbnb! It was the nicest one we have stayed at. There are so many extra touches that we kept finding that made our stay great. Like an extra electric adapter, shampoo and body wash, a welcome kit with scones and jam, coffee and tea. And much more! It is beautifully decorated and so well remodeled. The building it was in was historic and gorgeous. Just like the pictures and even better. The only thing that we were uncomfortable with was the neighborhood. It was a little tougher than we expected, but we always felt very safe inside and transportation was easy. The underground stations were close by and the buses. We took a cab a lot since we have a large family. We just didn’t hang out in the nearby area. Although we did shop at the little local market almost everyday and there prices were very reasonable. Overall, we would definitely stay here again. The place is so roomy and gorgeous with the vaulted ceilings and a lot of extra space. The bathrooms were awesome with the buttons to turn on. So cool! Also, the fans were the best! There were one to two fans per room which made ALL the difference for the hot weather. Cooled down the place so quickly!"

The subway was less than 10 mins walk, two grocery stores less than 5 mins walk, with many many restaurants and pubs nearby. Lovely apartment with high end appliances and finishes and perfect for our family of 4. We even washed clothes on our last day before leaving for our next destination Paris. Would definitely book again!"

She showed me around the area, and introduced me to the Caribbean foodie heaven :) her house is sparkling clean, the room is quiet , and apartment is close to Westfield London which is great. Also it s a 10 min walk to Uxbridge road where you can enjoy all the deliciousness of  Middle East cuisine"
7498746,168276960,09/07/2017,65209114,Stacey,"Perfect place for my husband and I to stay for a few days as we went to sightsee London. It was quiet and comfortable, away from the hustle and bustle of London city, but also convenient to catch the tube and bus. Sonali was a very gracious host, available, and caring. We would recommend staying with her!"

The apartment was very clean. Adrian is very friendly and approachable. He also responds very quickly and is a great host. Highly recommend!"

21439449,214706558,26/11/2017,2686223,Thy,"The location is very conveniently located. The room itself is quite basic. We were only looking for a decent and clean room to sleep in as we were gone most of the day, and that's what we found here. The guys have been very hospitable and accommodating (giving us the opportunity to leave luggage before checkin and after checkout). And were very considerate and involved, without being in your face 24/7."
43090169,723304622,10/01/2021,165991253,Jom,"Absolutely gorgeous flat! The location is just brilliant, right at Covent Carden - everything was very well appointed and such a please to stay there, surprisingly not noisy! Each bedroom is very comfortable with professional mattress and linen. The living room has a large TV with gadget, internet was fast and stable. The whole flat was spotless clean and very highly maintained. Bottom line - 5 stars for the host providing excellent service in an outstanding flat. I do have to say that Jessa and her team should give a master class on how a host should communicate with their guests! Our reservation was on last minute and we’re checked in within less than an hour! Couldn't be any better! I would recommend this place 100% and would certainly stay there again in the future!"

She is an OUTSTANDING host and a very pleasant, caring person. Her apartment is equipped with literally everything you may need during your stay and there are multiple routes that connect to the city centre fairly quickly. Definitely one of the best experiences on Airbnb so far, I will no doubt be back at her place for a future stay in London."

Leiligheten er helt fin og praktisk, vi bodde der 1 uke og det funket for oss. Den er faktisk litt større enn du får inntrykk av i profilen. Vi kan tenke oss å bo der igjen. "

The apartment is exactly the same as in the pictures, clean and in a perfect neighbourhood. You are at 10minutes by feet from the Bethnal Green Station and there is a bus station just 3mijutee from the apartment. I would recommend this apartment to anyone who wants to enjoy London but still find a quiet place to rest at night. "

You couldn’t meet a nicer host than Stefania; friendly, helpful and very kind – she even picked me up from the Tube station. The room is exactly as it is in the pictures - spacious, clean and with a very comfy bed. You have access to your own private bathroom which is more like an ensuite and you are only minutes away from local transport links that take you into the heart of London. Enjoy the busyness of London and then relax in the peaceful leafy suburbs of Morden as there is no better place to stay than with Stefania.      "
3645778,133913131,25/02/2017,12156430,Elana,Tass's place was in a great location and he was extremely helpful with our travel plans.  He was flexible with check-in and check-out as well as helped with travel tips and suggestions.  I would highly recommend Tass's place to anyone interested.  The location is also right near Portobello Market in the Notting Hill neighborhood and within ten minutes from the nearest tube stop.  The only issues were that the oven was difficult to use and the television did not work.

There are lovely restaurants and amenities a short walk away. The décor and amenities of the flat will make you feel like a guest in your friend's home and not a weary traveler plopped into an empty flat.  We had a wonderful time and didn't need for a single thing while we were there. If I could give her more than 5 stars, I would!"

从住宿地方走两个街口,就有一个非常大的超级市场,再走一个街口就是以前伦敦旧的唐人街,有很多中国美食,非常不错｡
主人Viviana和她的男朋友人非常友善,非常热情的告诉我怎么到达,还很贴心的一直等我们入住｡房间很大,Viviana是个非常整洁的房东,家里每个地方都很干净,一尘不染｡
Viviana非常热心允许我们使用她的厨房,我们使用了很多次厨房来做食物吃｡非常感谢!

The underground doesn’t come all the way to Lou’s place but still very easy to get to central London by bus or a combo of bus and underground, only 30-45 minutes away from the most of popular sites. Would stay there again!"
17837193,188701806,30/08/2017,8901264,Alice,"First of all, location of the apartment is perfect, 15mns walk to the Westminster Abbey, the Big Ben etc. Supermarket, pharmacy within 5mns walking range. Because we are a family of 5, so we call uber for the transport, it comes every time less than 5mns. Superb location. The neighborhood is super quiet, even beside the road. 
The apartment itself is well decorated and configured, clean and comfortable, they prepared towels for everyone, really nice. But just for your information, the apartment is configured in 3 levels, so if you have a baby less than 2 years old, there will be some stairs, but they've already installed a baby guard bar at the highest level, very thoughtful. 
Anyway, we had enjoyed our trip in London and the apartment as well. Thanks."

5270412,563303567,12/11/2019,93940759,Luke,"This place is much better than just about any comparably priced hotel you could find in all of London. It is probably better than much more expensive hotels, too! The ease of check in, incredible amenities, and unbeatable location made our stay in London so good. It’s in a nice part of town with plenty of shops and restaurants nearby, and the close locality to Paddington and Queensway made getting around so convenient. The space itself is stylish, modern, and incredibly comfortable. The bed is lush, the kitchen has anything you could possibly want, and Ann even left some food in there for us! As I mentioned, much better than any hotel room we could have hoped for. We had a couple of large suitcases, and while it was a little bit of a hassle to carry them down the staircase leading to the room, it wasn’t too terrible. Overall, we had a lovely stay. 10/10!"

7753097,257727342,27/04/2018,22141566,Robin Antoinette,"Die Wohnung ist ruhig, günstig und hat eine gute Busverbindung auch spät abends. Wenn du von Stansted kommst, achte darauf, dass National Express hält im Stadtteil Bow oder genau gesagt Bow Church an auch wenn auf der Fahrkarte London Bow steht. Du steigst dort aus um weiter mit dem Bus zu fahren. Wir haben diese Haltestelle auf der Hin und Rückfahrt falsch bei (Hidden by Airbnb) Maps eingegeben und sind dort nicht ausgestiegen. Da wir London nicht kannten, hat es uns lange aufgehalten zur Wohnung am ersten abend anzukommen. Der 242 hält gleich vor dem Haus an. Das Hochhaus hat ein Tor der Concierge veranlässt dass du öffnen kannst. Der Garten hat Palmen und ist sehr schön. Glücklicherweise gibt es ein Concierge und du störst niemand, wenn du spät ankommst.  Wenn du in die Stadt fahren möchtest, die Buslinie 242 von Manville Street (vom Haus aus rechts dann erste Strasse links) nimmt dich Richtung Dalston Station.  Wir fühlten uns dort wie zu Hause und fanden alle Leute sehr freundlich und hilfsbereit. Danke Francesca"

18732642,518860246,27/08/2019,59132357,Kathryn,"We stayed at this lovely Greenwich apartment with our two children aged 4 and 6. The apartment itself was absolutely perfect, clean and comfortable and with plenty of space and storage for a family of 4. Rasheed had thought of absolutely everything and we really appreciated the extra touches like tea/coffee/oils/spices/jams and plentiful toiletries supplied. I have never stayed in an Airbnb which offered as many helpful items as this one. As it was August and extremely hot in London, we very much appreciated the fans in each room! 

Location wise this apartment is perfect. A very short walk from the train/DLR /Underground/Cutty Sark and a short walk to the National Maritime museum, Observatory and Greenwich Park and Market. Excellent bars and restaurants on the doorstep. Our kids enjoyed the little playground right behind the apartment block. The Waitrose right downstairs was very handy too. 

As a host, Rasheed was very welcoming and communicative and provided lots of really helpful information about the apartment, the area and travelling. He was very easy to contact and we would highly recommend him as a host and his apartment as an excellent place to stay."

I arrived to Gasia's at 3am because of my flight and she called me then so I was saved from the cold. I was traveling with my fiancee and we both felt the good energy coming from Gosia and her flat. 
I recommend Gosia to everyone."

5878160,503673517,06/08/2019,140642093,J David,"Although I can give an overall recommendation for this flat for other guests, both for the location and excellent service by Emily and especially if your visit is during a cooler month, because of not being able to go directly to the Airbnb flat (ie. via lockbox) and because there is no A/C (as is common with most flats in the area), we won’t be returning to this flat next year for the next Prudential RideLondon 100 which was the primary reason for our visit.  This was our first visit to London and although the weather is normally cooler, due to the recent heat wave, the flat was much warmer than we would have preferred at night to sleep.  Therefore in order to ensure against unusually warm weather should we return for the same event in August 2020, we will book a flat with A/C or stay in a hotel.

We flew into and out of Gatwick airport (which was fortunate considering a strike at Heathrow resulted in 177 cancelled flights the day of our return home).  We arrived at Gatwick at 9:45am and after picking up our luggage and taking the 30 minute Gatwick Express to London Victoria Station and walking to the hotel office, we arrived at the office at noon.  If you are arriving via Victoria Station, although the distance to the hotel office (where the keys are picked up) and the actual flat aren’t that far, when walking with luggage (and especially when it’s raining as it was upon our arrival), it becomes much more cumbersome so consider taking an UBER or taxi.  Although check in time is normally 2pm, Emily had said the flat might be ready sooner so when we arrived at the hotel office at noon and were told by the guy behind the counter that the Airbnb flat was still being cleaned, we were disappointed but not surprised and were asked to go downstairs to a little restaurant to wait.  We were only there a few minutes when a woman running the restaurant (turns out it was Emily’s mom) asked where we were staying.  When I replied the Airbnb, she looked at her tablet and said the Airbnb was indeed ready and that the guy at the front desk was new and didn’t know about status of the Airbnb (even though I specifically said “Airbnb”), so I was glad we didn’t have to wait that long.

Access to the flat building is via a key fob (or phone on the wall if someone is in the flat to let you in).  The flat is on the 1st floor which means going up one flight of stairs or taking the elevator.  We were in Flat #4 which is laid out into three separate rooms (bedroom, living room, bathroom)  with a huge living room window overlooking Rochester Row. We did have a couple of minor issues during our stay (ie. shower head nozzle came off and missing a shower mat) which Emily quickly resolved by the next day.   To cool down the flat, we had to open the living room and bedroom windows which cooled down the bedroom at night; however, introduced all of the outside night noises to include police cars barreling down the street with sirens blaring at all hours as well as noisy pedestrians chatting away while walking past the building returning from a pub or walking their dog in the early AM before going to work.

There is a small combination washer/dryer in the flat which was nice to get a few things washed half-way during our trip.   The refrigerator has no separate freezer so it would be nice if a styrofoam picnic chest was provided in which a bag of ice can be stored.   There is a Local Sainsburys grocery store about 5 minutes north up Rochester and both a Tesco and Little Waitrose grocery stores about 5 minutes south on Warwick to purchase food items during your stay.  Internet access is very quick.

A bus stop is just a few minutes walk up Rochester for easy access to other parts of London.  And of course there is Victoria Station for access to the tube and Gatwick Express.   Rather than having to deal with an Oyster card (bus, tube, and train travel) and figuring how much to add and dealing with any resulting balance, we had our credit card company issue us with “contact less” cards instead as these (Amex, Visa, MC) are accepted on the above modes of transportation as well.  Still somewhat new to the USA, you simply tap your card on a panel and you’re good to go.  Note however, there is a £30 maximum limit on using a contactless card, so I had to use the credit card slot instead when purchasing two £19 Gatwick Express tickets.

For bus tours (Windsor Castle, Oxford, Stonehenge, Harry Potter), we used Evans Evans tours.  Their office is about a 15 minute walk from the flat.

There are several restaurants nearby including two Italian restaurants.  Our experience at 2 Amici (few minute walk up Rochester) was not good as there were gnats flying around us the entire time we were there, not to mention, it didn’t sound like any of the employees were Italian.  We weren’t offered bread, so when I asked, each slice was burned.  We much preferred Gustoso (one street down and turn right on Willow Pl) where both the food, service, and employees were all excellent and authentic Italian. As the locals generally eat later (7-8pm), we found we could get into restaurants immediately when they opened (generally 6pm) without a reservation."

It is a quick walk from Wembley Park station, which is a quick half hour tube ride into the very center of London. There are also plenty of restaurants and things to do in the area. I would book this apartment every single time I am in London if its available. Moushumi was so nice, and left many thoughtful touches in the apartment like a bottle of wine. Highly recommend!!"

20892431,225370516,06/01/2018,13553688,Louise,"The flat is nice, very convenient, well refurbished and the location is good. 

Nevertheless, because of the social misbehaviour of the neighbours, I preferred to shorten my stay and report their behaviour to the police. They put a very rude note on the flat’s door intended to the previous visitors. I took off the note as I was supposed to stay 3 weeks and I obviously didn’t want to see that every single day. The neighboors have then been aggressive and even insulted me. 
Moreover, I would have appreciated more attention toward my situation and more reactivity from the hosts given the emergency of my case, especially because as a real estate agency, they have the expertise to do so.
The agency asked me to give them more time to find me an alternative flat. I paid for this additional night but the agency hasn’t found anything in return. I had to look after this by myself. 

Notice that the building is very poor insulated and you will do hear people walking and talking.  

I can't give anything else than one star.

I was flying out of Gatwick early the next morning, and her place is conveniently located near Clapham Junction, which connects you to the airport. There are two bus stops near her home that connect you easily to the city and to the train station, plus you’re not too far from Clapham Common tube station. Michelle is really great to talk to and get to know! The bed is comfortable and the room is a nice size, with a view out to the garden. I highly recommend staying here!"

The room was large enough and we had our own shower. The toilet was right in front of the room and we were the only guests so we had everything for ourself. Yvonne also made tasty breakfast for us every morning. The metro station is 10 minutes walk from the house, but the neighborhood is nice so you can enjoy a walk."

Gabe welcomed me at the door when I arrived, and allowed me to leave key in the room when I need to leave very early. It's my first time to try a shared house on B&B for travel alone. and it turned out not bad, surprisingly better than I thought. Very convenient and safe location"
17197721,337695812,17/10/2018,121702437,Myriam,"The best thing of John's place is its location, very centric, surrounded by supermarkets and all kinds of shops, near the main museums, excellent transportation links,  jet very quiet since the windows face an inner courtyard. The building has lifts  useful for persons with disabilities and getting in your luggage. Though is not stylish or everything brand new, it has all you need and everything in working order. Also John is very receptive to all your needs and responds quickly. We had a great stay."
21102659,345521436,05/11/2018,1554735,Tania,"The location is amazing and almost could not be better right on Brick-lane in a super trendy vibrant area of town. Facilities up kept almost daily as there are guest checking in and our regularly. Room and facilities are true to pictures, economically decorated with good taste. Could do with re-investing profits to upgrade areas like the bathrooms and some of the kitchen areas. TV did not work while we were there. It was flagged to the host but we did not receive a response nor did anyone attempt to fixed during our stay. House & room was self checkin. Only communication after checking was a warning to all guests advising not to leave items out of their rooms, which made us feel a little unwelcome. Everyone staying in the apartment however was very friendly. The most important consideration when booking the apartment would be the stairs. they are very step, narrow and irregular. I am unsure if they meet legal requirements. My advise is travel light ie small to no suitcase and watch your step on every stair, as failing could be deadly."

The area felt safe and was really quiet considering the proximity to a massive arena.  There was a big Tesco nearby and Twickenham town not far away. My room was clean, comfortable and I had everything I needed. The shower was powerful and there were some toiletries available in case I had forgotten anything.  The view from my room over the garden onto the stadium was fab. Francesca was away during my stay but her mum was there to look after me and was really lovely.  Really recommended."

It's beautifully decorated and furnished throughout, with really comfy beds and has everything you could need. It's a wee gem tucked away along a quiet mews street. 
Belsize Park is a lovely part of London with plenty of great cafes/restaurants to choose from. I'd recommend the local pizza place 'Franco Manca' on Haverstock Hill! The tube station is a 5 minute walk away from the apartment with frequent trains into central London.  A short walk up to Primrose Hill is worth it for the great views across London. 
Jale was a fantastic host - our flight was delayed slightly but she was able to meet us later than planned and helped us get our bags to the apartment. She was available to contact throughout our stay and was really friendly and helpful. 
Would love to come back and stay again some time. "

24733568,355473050,04/12/2018,19797953,Hannah,"The apartment was lovely and much better than it looks in the photos. The lift wasn't accessible which would have been nice to have known before we got there and the buzzer didn't work so when we were all arriving there was a lot of going up and down the several flights of stairs to let people in. Collecting the keys was a bit of a pain, firstly it is too far away from the apartment and secondly we weren't told that photo ID would be needed (despite having the itinerary and proof of name by way of bank card and professional website with her face on!). There weren't any pillows for the sofa beds just a duvet(with cover) and sheet, oh and no curtain in the living room and we were using both sofa beds, thankfully it was winter but I imagine that is awful in the summer. Overall we enjoyed the apartment and it has been nicely decorated, great top floor views and just right for what we needed. It was let down a little by the customer service and the little personal touches you get with other airbnb places but not here."

However they were very kind during the process and easy to contact. Appart from that, everything was perfect: the apartment is in excellent conditions and is very good located (two subway stations one block away). Two things to take into consideration. First, the mattress is not bad, but it is not that comfortable. However, we stayed for 6 nights and we did have an acceptable rest. Second, there is not a single contact in the bathroom to plug a hair dryer or any other device that is usually used in the bathroom. We had to use one that is outside the bathroom. 
All in all, we definitely would stay again at that apartment."

The apartment is really well located, very close to the Barbican Center (place of fantastic concerts) and to the Museum of London, very interesting and free.
There is a market in the street quite every day, a supermarket in the street... and it is really completely quiet in night.
I strongly recommend this apartment for a perfect stay in London !"

But if you like or want to walk, maybe this point is not a big deal for you. The house is an hour kind of to victoria station.
There is not lift in the building so, you have to climb 3 floor with your luggage.
She and her son are beautiful, so hospitality and good person. 
She has a nice bath and kitchen, so complete to stay few night there. 

Xoxo! ❤"

21484084,263238298,11/05/2018,185315542,Francis,"I booked Ali's room for my parents who were coming to London to enjoy their holidays and they had a wonderful stay thanks to Ali.

She is pretty kind and so helpful, if you need anything just ask her as she is always happy to help. Also, her french is really good and as my parents don't speak english, it helped them a lot. 

Ali has a cat, Molly, the house's gorgeous Diva, what a sweet fluff ball. 

The flat is clean, everything about Ali's accomodation is great and it is really close from Streatham Common Station which is so comfortable when you're coming from Gatwick Airport. 

Ali is with no doubt, a superhost !"

Everyone in the family is friendly. The home is also very clean. The room is small but has everything that I need for my few days stay in London.

With 3 beds/bedrooms, the space was large enough to comfortably for our group of 6 adults. The large couch and communal space was great for relaxing, and the location was ideal. Just a bit east from Soho, tucked away on a quiet street, but right off a tube line and very walkable to many areas. 

I highly recommend the cafe, Store St. Cafe, located at the end of the block as well! Perfect to run out and quickly grab coffees for the group in the morning. 

Everything regarding set up and check in with the host went super smoothly. I would definitely recommend."

Respecto a los comentarios que se oye mucho el ruido de la calle o de la entrada, comentar que es un barrio muy tranquilo que casi no pasan coches, si pasa algun transeunte o alguien sale a la calle se oye pero es muy puntual.
Facilidad para dejar las maletas antes de irnos y poder disfrutar de Londres hasta el último momento.
Por poner una pega, se deberia de mejorar la luz que entra por la mañana. A las 6 de la mañana la habitación ya esta iluminada completamente, solo hay unos estores opacos, pero se filtra toda la luz, para quien le moleste la luz esto puede ser un problema, hay un doble riel que se podria aprovechar.
En resumen, totalmente recomendable."

Its smaller than expected, it wasnt ""shiny"", generally clean but if you expect a totally shiny experience this isn't for you. We had some heat issues, the heater is set to work only 12 hours a day, more or less from 5 to 10 in the morning and from (Phone number hidden by Airbnb) to (Phone number hidden by Airbnb) , if you come back late at night like 2-3am you may find the room a bit cold during cold days... The kitchen has only the super essential stuff (fried pan, dishes etc), nothing else, even not a bottle of water or a sponge to clean the dishes or a towel for the dishes or some salt/pepper you need to buy everything. Personally when I rent an entire place with a functional kitchen I expect to find some salt or pepper etc. The neighbourhood is totally quiet, at late night a bit ""more quite"".  Overall the quality to price ratio is semi/good, more like a student appartment, for young people travelling with not high requirements its fine, you can cook and sleep well(not the best mattress), close the Public Transport and the host always available to communicate through (Hidden by Airbnb) or the airbnb app."

I've stayed in one of Marta and Sam's flats before and their communication is always very clear and speedy in response to questions. This flat overlooks the main road which might be a bit noisy for some people. The one less pleasant thing about the flat, which has been mentioned in a couple of other reviews, is that there was a strong, stale odour in the bathroom - but the hosts have said they're looking into it so hopefully it will be sorted out soon. Otherwise a very comfortable, well-located flat for a short stay."

He's very approachable and welcoming...the room is spacious, comfy and clean and just perfect for what I needed... would recommend the room not only because of how it looks but because of how homely the host (Julian) makes you feel...would definitely stay there again..."
19763087,325983619,21/09/2018,179691362,Chris,"Abdul was very helpful and great to communicate with. His home is in a great location, and it was very easy to get around. 
However, we were not as impressed with the cleanliness (primarily the bathroom), and we found the smell of smoking to be difficult to be around. Due to asthma, and sensitivity to smells, and the smoke was very strong. We felt mislead as the add says no smoking, and there was no mention of the host smoking. While he did seem to only smoke in his room, we were able to smell it quite easily in our own room and the common spaces."
8796376,196883294,24/09/2017,118429738,Rob,"I'm writing this with complete transparency as to stay honest and helpful to other travelers. I will list both the pro's and con's. 

Pro's: 
Very central location - even after we explored the neighborhood, we realized our spot was the closest to so many restaurant options! The walk to Victoria Station was about 5 minutes.
The garden area was a great perk during our downtime. It's private and relaxing - total zen. 
Our bed linens and towels smelled so fresh, which we really appreciated.
The bathroom amenities such as bodywash and shampoos were of high quality. 

Con's:
Our stay was brief but over the course of a few days, we never got a full night's rest due to the noise. Not sure why vacuuming at 4am was being done. The building's alarm was going off for a few minutes one night around 1am. We had multiple experiences of noise throughout each night.
There is not central air and it got very warm and muggy pretty often, so that was uncomfortable. 
We thought one night to sample some of the teas that were on the counter, so we wanted to use the electric kettle. Upon opening it up to fill it with water, we noticed the kettle had not been cleaned and there was stuff floating inside. We did not make tea after seeing that it had not been cleaned. 
The bathroom was also tiny. The placement of the toilet is not ideal since the sink is directly in front of it, causing you to sit a little sideways. 

Overall, the pro's outweighed the con's for us. It was a nice stay for the most part. Gigi was very responsive to our questions."
23853094,355685702,05/12/2018,226088573,Alba,The host canceled this reservation 2 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.

They have a lovely home with everything you need to make yourself comfortable."

20721405,226567829,11/01/2018,56496681,Giulia,"Richard is a super kind man. He was helpful from the very first moment. 
The house is super comfortable with a private room and a very nice bathroom. The kitchen is new and well equipped and Richard made us feel at home, leaving us the freedom to eat and cook. He also offered cereal, bread, coffee and tea: everything super fresh and of good quality. My mother and I felt like at home and would definitely come back.
The house was warm and Richard didn't hesitate to increase the home temperature when I asked him. 
The location is great: the train station Maze Hill is a few minutes away and in less than 20 minutes it takes you to London Bridge. It is lovely to walk to the train station because there is a lot of green around.
The house architecture is peculiar and beautiful.
I am sad we had to leave so soon! 
Richard thank you again!!!

1510477,6679826,20/08/2013,3450113,Fay,"Caroline's place is in a beautiful, quiet and leafy part of north London, while being very convenient for transport to central London and with easily walkable access to a great range of shops and restaurants. 

The flat itself is calm, light and comfortable with lovely design touches, it is the opposite of a bland, featureless hotel. I stayed in the side room which is not large, but has space for everything and is almost totally silent - it has a very comfortable bed with an exceptional mattress. Caroline is a friendly, fascinating and thoughtful host who can be there when you need her (or when you just want a chat) but will leave you alone if you prefer. Her dog Huntley will quickly make you feel welcome, but if you're not too keen on dogs then don't worry as he does not jump up and is very placid and well-trained. 

The garden is a wonderful place to relax after a day of working/sightseeing and it gets the sun almost the whole day. I spent much of my visit relaxing reading a book on the deck with a glass of wine - really lovely! 

I highly recommend Caroline's place as a great alternative to staying in a hotel.

12820614,163251031,24/06/2017,122036950,Alex,"As described, the place is an efficiency.  But it is well equipped and nicely maintained and the location can't be beat.  It is close to two underground stations and walking distance to the Tower of London and several nice restaurants and pubs.  Communications with Eti were seamless.  I think I read one or two reviews saying the neighborhood was loud.  I think I should correct those reviews.  It is a relatively quiet area, but there is a major road nearby where the occasional vehicle (motorcycles usually) can pass by noisily. 
 Highly Recommended!"

You get the use of his living room, which is as large as a good sized hotel room. Thomas himself is polite,  quiet and out most of the time. Even though this is a private room in someone else's apartment, it is like having the place to yourself."

It was much more spacious than the pictures really show, being a basement flat as some have commented we had realized from the pictures didn't mind this at all! Means you have some outdoor space. It was nice and warm in the place, the beds were comfortable. There was plenty of wardrobe space.. plenty of towels. Really anything you could ask for. We were a family of three plus a grandmother and everyone enjoyed themselves, we will be back!"

Soseska je tiha in varna, veliko možnosti za dobit  v okolici topel obrok. Gostitelja sta vedno bila na raspolago, sva se počutila komfortno in sproščeno. Čistoča je idealna. Čeprav soba ni velika, je opremljena kot za se. Po celodnevnem potepu zjutraj sva se vedno zbudila spočita. Kaj lepšega za popotnike.  Postelja je široka, zelo udobna. Kopalnica je na drugem koncu hiše,  zato ni skrbi, da bi se kdo motil. Idealen kraj za bivanje v Londonu službeno ali zasebno. Z veseljem bom priporočila to hišo prijateljem."

You’ll be sharing the space with Angie and her husband but I only saw them on the night we arrived and she couldnt have been friendlier. Battersea has a real local charm to it. I feel like I got to understand what London was all about there. One very minor downside is that it’s not close to an underground stop but there are plenty of busses to connect you to where you need to be

Her flat was super clean and had amazing views of the river. As mentioned, this is her primary home and still contained all of her things during my stay -- I didn't find this to be a problem and had found there was still plenty of space to hang up my clothes, etc. Additionally, it was nice to have amenities like the washing machine for use. Caro was a top-notch host -- she reached out to ensure I had everything I needed over the week , left me snacks to have on my first morning in London, and even offered to loan me her membership card to the Tate museum. A great choice!"
20756079,356910670,09/12/2018,64808370,Nigel,"The flat is okay, but could do with being looked over ahead of a guest arriving - probably an issue where you have it managed for you and they employ a contract cleaner.
Self check in was fine, however there were some issues with the flat.

The TV does not work and when I arrived there was no internet working. They offered to send somebody the following day, however as it was only a place for me to lay my head for a couple of nights I suggested they should come after I left.
Turned out a whole side of the kitchen had no power (fridge, oven, dishwasher and sockets) hence the WiFi wasn't working. Incidently, when you do plug it in the signal is very weak, barely reaching the sitting room (its an old router).

The outside patio (not used) was very dirty, an issue with mud and pigeons that had forced its way under the patio doors making the bottom of them very dirty inside the sitting room. A good cleaner would have spotted this.

Its an older flat, no double glazing so the front bedroom is noisy and the wind gets through the windows all through the flat. On the positive, the heating is very good. The master bedroom at the back sees no sun and feels a little damp. Furniture is good, if a little grubby, but that's a white sofa issue in general, beds have older mattresses.

To sum up then, needs some TLC overall, needs the managing company to inspect and test before guests arrive and is probably a little overpriced as is.
This runs against the other reviews, although there have not been any for a while, but its an honest appraisal.
I would not stay again."

The check in and communication was great.  The block is 1960's style local authority. Inside the flat is clean and modern and with nice touches.  It was noisy in the evenings from teenagers hanging out on the basketball court which is within the block and the restaurants were noisy until everyone went home between 11 and midnight.  Not a huge problem unless you want an earlier night.  I was unaware the exact setting of this flat and it is within a block that has social housing so the main entrance way is full of notices about social housing and the tenants that we encountered around the building were clearly having a difficult time of things.  As a Londoner who has lived in blocks of flats like this it didn't feel hugely 'special' to be staying here and I felt uncomfortable when I encountered the residents.  Amazing location for walking everywhere and opposite a well know great fish and chip restaurant."

17237833,443199977,25/04/2019,75280777,Karla,Ankita's place is very accessible in terms of transportation. The train station is 5-10 minutes away from her home. The neighbourhood is very quiet and peaceful. Her place was sparkling clean and her hospitality is outstanding. We had everything we needed at her place and the private access and bathroom is a huge plus. I highly recommend staying with Ankita and I will definitely be coming back!

294177,2624354,15/10/2012,3188603,Seth,Great Host with a Cosy Studio flat.  It was situated a short walk from a train to London City center which then gives you access to the whole city.  He was very accommodating as I rented a car and got lost for a few hours.  We caused a little issue for the next visitors as we forgot to leave the guest parking so if there is a negative reflection by a future guest to Oliver it is not his fault.

The place was well laid out and very clean and all the elements were there to meet our comfort needs. It was also well located; close to all the services we needed.  We really recommand renting Richard's apartment for anyone who wants to enjoy a nice stay in London.

During the morning, you can take your coffee in the garden and enjoy the tweets from the birds! So relaxing! The closest metro station is at 5 min walk and you're in downtown London in less than 20 min! "

Such a great area for getting transport all over London, and there are loads of good bars and restaurants within walking distance.

7201329,286412042,06/07/2018,58360862,Tab,Really nice location  only a couple of minutes walk from Brixton station. The flat was in a noisy location  as well as having noise carry between other flats in the block. It was bright but exceptionally warm as the windows only opened a little way. May need to provide more kitchen equipment for longer stays. Nice on the whole.

21196966,231920709,03/02/2018,83014368,Fiona,"The flat is in a great location close to lots of restaurants and not too far from an underground station. It's well-equipped and has lots of personal touches.
The shower wasn't great as the water pressure was quite weak and I had difficulty adjusting the temperature the first time I used it.
I only met Polly once but she was very friendly and she responded to all my online enquiries."
30906165,477493599,28/06/2019,70535909,Cs,"Lisa’s place was exactly what my family and I needed. We wanted to be in London but not in super busy locations like Piccadilly and in a place where we could spread out. Her flat was less than 10 minutes from West Brompton station and a very short walk to restaurants and markets. Thank you for your hospitality, Lisa!"

The room is clean and the house is hull of stunning artistic works, we really enjoy these items! Moreover, they serve rich and excellent breakfast, we can start our visiting after the meal and didn't need to worry what we need to eat every morning! The apartment was very well located, and it helped us to easily arrive the sightseeing in a short time. Sally and Mathias' home is really a nice place to recommend in London!"

It felt truly luxurious, with our own beautiful bathroom (including tub!), and projector + screen to watch Netflix from bed, and lots of small extras (like packets of face masks!).  It is walking distance to Greenwich (which is a must visit) and Deptford.  Despite being on a busy street, the room is at the back and very peaceful!  Would highly recommend!!"

The extra space with having a bedroom as well as a living area was wonderful. The kitchen was great and we cooked a lot of our meals at the flat. There were a couple of grocery stores nearby. 

David was a wonderful host answering all of questions and helping us to get to know West Hampstead. The area is amazing, there are so many great shops, restaurants, cafes and parks close by. 

We had everything we wanted or needed within walking distance including tube and train stations. All of the sights to see in downtown London were easily accessible with a quick tube ride. 

We would book David's flat again for sure."

The bathroom and kitchen are very high quality. 

The wifi is very slow."

Seule critique, le matelas beaucoup trop mou, à 2 dessus on s’enfonce beaucoup."
18474480,215034101,27/11/2017,52267191,Kate,Lisa's place was an amazing find.  We were able to drop our bags off early which was a plus and it was super clean when we returned to check in.  The check in process was very easy and it was nice to have the little safe box to hold the keys so you didn't have to worry about carrying them around or losing them while out exploring.  The location is great if you're looking to be close to the underground tube and there are some nice restaurants nearby.  I would definitely return to Lisa's place!

388767,17995463,20/08/2014,13867169,Anne,"We stayed three nights at Tessa's place with two adults and two children (6 and 8). With two further air matresses on the floor the room was of course less spacious, but still big enough for us. Despite the traffic in front of the house we slept well, for more sensitive people Tessa keeps fresh earplugs at hand. 
She was a very friendly and helpful host. Coming home to her place after a day in busy London was always nice. Camden Town station is near, bus stations with many connections even nearer so the flat felt quite central, although it is not in the most bustling part of Camden.
We felt welcome and would stay there again."
29281987,672323102,08/10/2020,360163126,Anvi,It was a lovely experience. Christina was always available to assist with almost anything. The place is sparkling clean and is exactly as it looks in the pictures. Thank you for the stay. It was lovely being here.
24146993,570314273,29/11/2019,139143808,Stacey And Andrew,"We just returned from our stay at this flat and highly recommend it to anyone looking for a place to stay near Central London.  This spot is only 20 minutes by express train to several Central London train stations.  You can walk to catch a bus to the East Croyden station, but we decided to take an Uber from the flat to the train because of the chilly rain (welcome to November in London), but that was just a quick and inexpensive trip.  You can also catch a black cab from the station to the flat for about 7 pounds.  

The flat is sparkling clean and recently updated.  The beds are very comfortable and the location is quiet, leading to restful nights to allow for recuperating from sightseeing in London.  The kitchen has everything you need to cook and make coffee or tea, or just plenty of plates if you want to order a pizza or curry from a nearby restaurant from Uber Eats.  

Gary and Irina are responsive and helpful.  They communicated often and gave clear directions for getting into the building and the individual apartment and they left information about how to get to markets and restaurants nearby.  

We had a great stay and will definitely book this spot again when we decide to return to London."

It's just a shame that there is no Windows in the appartement, so no day light at all.  Plus, you have not To be tall because the seilling is very low. Exept that, everything was perfect"
37013794,567366134,22/11/2019,41453023,Suraj,"This apartment is very spacious and clean. Would definitely recommend.
The showers were fine and the apartment had two bedrooms; one en suite and one not.
The wifi was very slow and 4G was not easy to come by in the apartment so this would be my only worry, especially anyone needing to conduct business in the apartment.
The listing said including breakfast - this is a bit of a stretch. It had a tin of beans, come instant noodles, biscuit and UHT milk. I wouldn't classify this as ""breakfast"" personally.
The only other issue (might not be an issue to some) is the key collection and drop off is not at the apartment; it is a small taxi shop about an 8 minute walk away. On a good note, it is open 24/7 so potentially you can say there is flexible check-in.
Apart for that, the apartment was great; 24 hour security, comfortable living room and comfy beds! Unlike some other apartments nearby, there were no sounds of trains or building works so I could sleep and relax perfectly. Would definitely use again!"

The neighborhood is beautiful, safe but hilly which may be an issue for some.  There's a bus which stops right in front of the apartment and we certainly used specially at the end of a long day of sightseing. There are four flights of stairs leading up to the apartment but we didn't mind at all.  The living room is quite big and has a nice view of London.  The bedrooms are a good size, but the one with bunk beds is a bit cluttered.    Overall, we had a pleasant stay and do recommend Karen's apartment."

Zeus the dachshund is a good companion while you unwind on the couch after a long day.

He helped me prior to my arrival with another matter,kept regular communication throughout and greeted me when I arrived late. During my stay, the place was comfortable and peaceful. The place was made even better as Adrian allowed me use his kitchen for breakfast which he provided. Upon check out, he let me leave my luggage until I collected it later. Adrian was also friendly and open to having a chat. the place itself is close to public transport and easy to get to. Overall, the place is highly recommended if you are staying in London.

19692156,609593286,23/02/2020,10641487,Howard,"The front desk staff and the staff in the downstairs coffee bar/café were extremely friendly, upbeat and helpful. 

Views from the top floor are stunning and while there’s no ‘personality’ as such to the spaces, the interior design company has clearly put a lot of thought into the them so they work well with a consistent, well resolved top drawer corporate hotel feel l. It’s stylish without being self conscious so it’s easy to feel at home, rather than like you’re in someone else’s home. 

It really has everything you need for a very comfortable stay. Having a great washer dryer for en extended stay is a real pleasure and access to a gym downstairs is great. 

The shallow shower tray and narrow screen do little to contain water but the bathroom is otherwise fantastic. 

The location is excellent and well located for public transport and the views are exceptional. I would definitely stay again and thoroughly enjoyed my visit - but I would point out that this is firmly a commercial apartment/hotel experience, rather than a community hosted Airbnb in the traditional sense.

14378646,416143930,24/02/2019,161050399,Kathleen,If central London is where you want to be then Peter’s palace IS the place to be! You’re right in the middle of all the action that central London has to offer at a VERY reasonable price. There are great shops and restaurants right around the corner from the flat that allows for the feeling of being a part of the neighborhood even to the point of getting coffee on the corner in your pj bottoms! Thank you Peter for everything! You helped to make our first visit to London memorable providing us the truth flavor of UK hospitality.

Looks like the pictures and have good modern decor and amenities for a business trip. Lots of food options around the corner, and transportation to and from the flat was super easy given a london underground station is very close walking distance away. Connection to Paddington via a short bus ride was a great thing too. Good communications and clear directions. Will recommend"

The apartment is near to one of London's interesting markets and to a lot of shops that sells African wax fabrics (what about Gerry informed me).
The room was nice and the bed very comfortable. The whole  flat was neat and clean, WiFi was great too.
Gerry was also a great help for my wish about finding a particular English book. Thanks Gerry for your pleasant lodging and for the interesting discussion."

What an amazing location. The flat was spotlessly clean, very cosy and comfortable. We stayed as a family of 6 (3 couples) and we thoroughly enjoyed ourself and made use of the flat. The hosts were so accommodating and friendly. The flat is literally on Brick Lane so we loved sitting with a coffee watching the hustle and bustle beneath us from the windows. The outdoor patio was a bonus! The sofa bed was extremely comfortable (felt like a normal double bed). Clean towels and special touches such as tea, coffee and sugar. 
So lovely to wake up to Brick Lane market on a Sunday morning. 
Thanks again for an amazing stay! We will definitely be back soon :)"

The whole experience was smooth and straightforward, from booking through to check-in and check-out. Communication was easy with Veronica and she was accommodating with our check-in/out time.  The apartment was clean and homey. We had a wonderful and comfortable stay at Veronica's place!"

Karen's interior decor is simple yet elegant. You'll feel cosy, comfortable and welcomed in her pleasant spare room. And you'll be offered lots of fresh and lovely breakfast options to help yourself to in the morning.

Great value for money in a beautiful part of London with extremely convenient transport links (I should know, I used to live locally)."
18854877,557107693,31/10/2019,12213636,Daniel,"I arrived to find the host and his agent in the apartment.  They noted that the place was less clean than they expected and thought the cleaners had left in the middle of the job. There was still a full drinking class next to the bed from the previous guest, dirty utensils and plates and the whole place looked drab.  They promised to get the cleaner back either later the day I arrived or the next day but failed to follow through.  The bathrooms are serious need of refurbishment. Heating in the master bathrooom was almost non-existent. The shower in the other was unusuable and the internet was very spotty.   Additionally, the hallway outside the door of the apartment was full of construction materials.  Overall, I thought the price was way too high in view of the condition of the apartment."

Train station and bus stop virtually on the doorstep and having a locked garage a bonus if you have a car. Reeva stayed in touch to make sure everything was ok.

241621,42136793,11/08/2015,15026708,Lan,"Clare has been very responsive and kind with our questions before the trip and although we haven't seen Clare much during our trip, she was very nice and welcomed us kindly on our first day. We spent 5 nights at Clare's house and it was ok. The house was not very clean except our room. The bathroom and kitchen/living room area could be better cleaned and vacuumed. Unfortunately there are no block-out curtains in the room so we have the light coming in early morning,difficult to sleep and plus the noise from the street (not always) because there is no double glazing window.  We found the bed not comfortable for 2 since it was too soft and the box spring was not in good shape, it would be better for only one person. 

We greatly appreciated the fresh nespresso in the morning which was kindly provided by Clare. The location of the house is ok, 15' walk from the Tooting Broadway tube station which is about 20' from London Bridge. "

Due to an unforseen circumstance,  we had to extend our stay by a week, she offered a complimentary cleaning service and cleared up the agenda ( for which she had booked maintenance works) to accommodate us. Her apartment is in an excellent location, with shops tubes and restaurants close by. The apartment itself is clean and airy. Would highly recommend to anyone considering staying here!

Jon's place was near where we originally planned on staying and he was quick to respond and accept our request. The house is beautiful and located near the end of a cobblestone road neighborhood tucked behind a few restaurants and cafes. Easily accessible to Kensington Gardens and a couple different transport lines (which we used extensively).  The room is on the third floor with a winding narrow staircase and is very spacious. Both their dogs are super sweet and we were excited to share some pets when we came and went. Quiet and stylish place for a London visit!"

If you are a light sleeper, you will need an eye mask and possibly earplugs - as the mezzanine

We chose this place with no expectations as we wanted to be in thamesmead and location was ideal for us as our family lives across the park from this address. We enjoyed the play park just at the doorstep of this house, and I even had a walk thru southmere park near this location. Parking is available too. Inside the house was tastefully decorated and we were impressed that it had underfloor heating! (though we did not use it as it was summertime!) There was plenty of room in the living room, and the main bedroom, we could pack our suitcases quite comfortably. Laurel was also very responsive over the messenger.  A very lovely experience and I could not find any fault at all with this lovely home. Thanks for letting us stay!"

The location is a little ways away from the London action but the 148 bus you can pick up around the corner takes you to the heart. Make sure you purchase an ""Oyster"" card for bus service as no cash or credit cards are accepted. Mike was very attentive and responsive to any question or request. Thanks again!"

The room was bright and the bed was so comfy, it was the perfect base for a visit back to the area visiting friends and family. Alex was easily contactable throughout the process and despite being oeverseas when we arrived, still made the process smooth for gaining entry. We had the room with private shower across the hallway but no issue whatsoever. 

Located about ten minutes walk to Beckenham Junction train station, lots of great cafes and Kelsey Park is just down the road, you really will have a lovely time if you use this as a base. Would happily stay here again should I visit from Sydney in the future."

They have a lot of suppliers in the kitchen and bathrooms and we really appreciated the convenience and thoughtfulness. 

The location is superb.  Very quiet and upscale, yet very close to the tourist attractions.

The convenient store around the corner carried a lot of the essentials.  Every Tuesday 10 am - 2 pm there is a food fair / market at the area near the convenience store and imperial college campus.  If you happen to be there, check out the awesome food trucks and farmer's market items!

As a family of five, it was ideal for us and a great location for us to show the best of London to our three kids. The accommodation is very well presented and the pictures represent the flat perfectly. Our hosts met us in advance of the booking-in time, gave us a quick tour of the property and were always just a text message or phone call away, should we need them, which we didn’t. This is a great property and way better than booking two hotel rooms for a family of five. Definitely recommend this property for couples or families keen to visit London. Make sure to check out Drury, the local coffee house just below the flat too - it’s fantastic. Thanks."

The only thing is he is not there( most airbnb house is like this now), personally i believe host better to be there, that's the whole point of airbnb. The house is clean, not in a very nice neighborhood but was OK. The driver told us it was one of the government project ( social housing). If you want convenience to the city, it's not a bad choice.

También nos han hecho sugerencias interesantes y se han preocupado en todo momento de que nuestra estancia haya sido cómoda. También agradecemos que nos hayan recogido del aeropuerto y nos lleven al mismo una vez finalizada nuestra estancia en Londres, por un precio muy razonable. Por otra parte, la casa aunque está un poco retirada del centro de Londres, está muy bien comunicada. Tiene parada de autobús justo delante de la casa y una estación de metro también muy cercana. Totalmente recomendable."

Even more it has lovely windows that show birch, plane tree,  cherry trees in the backyard private garden.  Lovely london clouds, wonderful sunset and bird songs, too.  It has lovely facade of red door in the  wonderful, interesting and quiet nottinghill area.  The bedrooms, livingroom & kitchen is large enough to stay and the bedroom has large bathtub.  Three of us did make most of our meals happily in this kichen.   We loved to make biscuits with this big oven.  Portobello antique market  was one of my pleasure on the weekends.
Though the distance is very far from NY to London, Tass did his best to our questions and demands sincerely all the time.  Lucky that we could stay happily and comfortly in this lovely house!"

2765443,16828468,03/08/2014,14925440,Eduardo,"I stayed in the house with my family for one month. The location is good, but the house had several problems. I have three general comments about the house: 
1. The internet was really too unstable. It was impossible to stay connected for a long time and we needed to switch on and off the rooter every 10 minutes.
2. The house was really not cleaned enough. Although the first floor had been swept, the carpet in the second floor had really a lot of dust. It is not expected that renters have to use the vacuum cleaner extensively (not for this price anyway). In some places we did not clean, there is still dust accumulated from ages. 
3. Some parts of the house are poorly maintained or need a renovation, specially:
a. the floor of the second floor, paved with some woody material and silver tape.
b. the back yard - This could be an asset for the house, but only the part in front of the kitchen is usable. The rest is so full of old stuff that is even impossible to enter.
c. the area behind the stairs needs a door.
d. the matrices of all the bedrooms, but especially form the smaller one are too old.
Considering the rent price, we did not expect these problems.

Double size bed is firm and comfortable,  and even my 6'5"" (195cm) husband had no problem sleeping in it.  The apartment, toilet and shower (the latter two are shared spaces) are clean.  Place is relatively quiet being in London and in an apt. complex.  There are lots of options for restaurants and or pubs nearby, such as in Camden and Fitzrovia.  Recommended."

It’s close proximity to the train station was so convenient and we felt safe given that we were three women traveling. Chris warned us about possible train closures which helped us plan our early morning trips. Their bathroom and shower alone made it worth every penny-best shower head I’ve ever seen.

It is situated smack in the middle of the best part of London, within short walking distance of great theater, museums, the British Film Institute, lots of wonderful restaurants, and shopping. It is located in a lively and interesting neighborhood which is also quiet enough for a good night's rest.  There is no smell from the Fish and Chips place downstairs.  The flat is even better than it looks in the pictures.  It is small but contains everything one needs for a very comfortable home away from home, it's newly and beautifully renovated, and immaculately clean (we are particular about this).  

Barry and Jill are very attentive and generous hosts.  They stock up the place with delicious food and drink (e.g., gourmet crackers, cookies, organic chocolate, juice, milk, wine, beer, breakfast ingredients) and lots of extra toiletries (extra towels, soap, tissue, toothpaste, even antibacterial hand gel Barry invites you to take along on your daily touring), adaptors for electric appliances and computers, and fresh flowers in every room.  Barry helped us with our heavy luggage and allowed us to leave our stuff there on the last day until minutes before the next guests were arriving.  While we were there, the dryer wasn't working properly, so Barry immediately proceeded to buy a new one and replace it.  We couldn't have possibly picked a better place in London and will certainly be back.  Thank you very much, Barry and Jill, for all of this.  See you in Israel!"

10831061,97578906,27/08/2016,64662429,David,"Angel was very helpful and the flat did the job; giving me somewhere to stay for my summer internship. The location is great if you are working in Canary Wharf, and not much of an effort to get into city. Poplar itself isn't the nicest place in the world but has its charm. The flat itself was at times horribly dirty, for the course of time there I was greeted by a pigeon that had nested in the roof and decided to do all its business outside the door, and electrical wiring dangling dangerously in front of the door almost caused me to strangle myself a few times after a night out. House had a constant horrible smell coming from the kitchen due to the recycling system that was cleaned out weekly, which got very bad at the end of the week. Flat has everything you need, would recommend spending a bit more cash if you are staying in London for a long time. Angel was very helpful and resolved some issues, and all in all can't knock the experience too much."
3882483,226389574,10/01/2018,130172258,Lin,Amazing location. It's really near London eye and Big Ben. And it's only 10 minutes' walk to China Town. It's very convenient.

Her place is well suited for our needs as it was within walking distance to both KingsCross and St Pancras stations. It was also within walking distance to where we wanted to go run our errands. Food was easily available at Islington within walking distance.
Her place is very comfortable and has all that we need. I would certainly recommend Judith's place for anyone wishing to explore that part of London.
Oh, she has an adorable cat which came to our room every night and slept with us. We are in love with that cat!"

6963613,150561495,08/05/2017,234063,Abbey,"Eleni's place is excellent if you're looking for a spot in north London. It's very close to a bus stop, and isn't far from the tube. It's close to both a nice, small park and Alexandra Palace, which is great for a day out with kids.
Eleni is extremely organized. She has thorough notes about everything, making a stay at her house a real pleasure: you don't have to feel like you need to pester her with questions while you're there. 
There isn't a TV in the living room (but there are two others in the house), which we loved, because she has a few board games and it made for a quieter overall experience for our family.
The only thing that wasn't quiet was the drilling/plastering work going on next door (probably only a concern for the next few weeks and if you have any travel companions who need quiet for daytime naps).
We really loved staying at Eleni's place and would absolutely recommend it and stay there again!"

Beatriz's apartment is absolutely lovely and very comfortable - with everything you might need for your stay. We wanted to move right in! It's extremely spacious - something that was important as I knew my elderly parents would spend more time inside. 
The keys and apartment were very easy to find and we had great communication with Beatriz before, during, and after our stay. It's on a busy road but dual storm windows mean you hear little noise from inside the apartment. Great restaurants nearby and Earl's Court tube station is close. 
Note that the front door takes a bit of finesse wiggling the key so don't get frustrated if it won't open right away. 
We would most definitely stay at this apartment again. "

17175413,253382634,14/04/2018,32808560,Yeany,"Very responsive host who guide us from station to their place, first we kinda lost since we didnt see the checkin guide at airbnb. Since this is our last day leave London and our flight at night, they are really kind to let us late check out until we leave for Heathrow. Recommended place, near bus stop, near places to eat, near supermarket as well. "
17607498,568238009,24/11/2019,66959331,Manon,Good location and clean. But not enough toilet paper on the second day. Also there are no curtains in the room: the pictures on airbnb don’t fit with reality!

Room clean, bathroom nice and quite big, with a tub in case you want to soak after a day in the city. 
Only problem are the narrow stairs, my room was on the third floor, and getting my carry on up was quite tricky."

Unfortunately the induction stovetop remained broken before we checked-in and while it was never fixed during my extended stay, Alex was able to provide us with a table-top solution in the interim which I really appreciated. All in all I would recommend Alex's place if you find yourself in Central London!"

The flat is grealty situated. It's about 10 min walk to the Underground station and 3 min to the Bus stop (one of the buses goes right to the Picadilly circus and Hyde Park). The area itself is quiet and safe. 
There was everything we needed in the flat. Literally everything. Kitchen is equipped very well.  There were my sister and me and we were ready to sleep in one bed, but Colum had an additional one in the living room so we felt very comfortable. The flat is pretty big, clean and light. It has private garden. 
Very cosy, we liked our stay pretty much."

I didn’t realize how close it was to Camden Lock which had so many amazing stores and eats. Not to mention steps away from the Canal. Which I highly recommend taking the London Water Bus.  

The home itself was much more than we expected. A wonderful huge patio which was so nice to have a cocktail or coffee on.

A peaceful upstairs over looking high street. A rainfall shower that was a dream at the end of a rainy day. 

Host was always in contact and very friendly, letting us drop our bags off before check in. Thanks for a awesome stay. Would recommend to anyone."

La cocina es pequeña y resulta algo incómoda pero está equipada con todo lo necesario para desayunar y cocinar  algún plato básico (aceite,vinagre,sal,azúcar,especias,pasta,leche,zumo...). El baño es amplio y el salón-dormitorio suficiente para dos personas. Cuenta con información detallada para una visita a Londres y algunos objetos que se hacen necesarios y se echarían en falta si no hubiera (productos de aseo personal y adaptadores para enchufes europeos).Aunque no conocimos a Rob y Alex creo que son unos grandes anfitriones ya que no disponían de plancha e inmediatamente se ofrecieron a solucionar el problema."

After staying in his house, I must definitely confirm all these opinions. Nice house, fantastic location, cleanliness, tranquility and discreption, as main qualities. I just want to add that Brendan is not only a very nice and special host, but also an artist, with his beloved guitar, and a poet... What to say more? In 12 nights I spent in Brendan's home (the last 3 with my wife), I really felt at home."

Nice and calm street, cozy historical house with a green back yard, bright and comfortable room on the second floor with shower and toilet at next door.

The flat is directly across from the Marylebone train and underground station which was extremely convenient and we were never bothered by noise from the train..  All in all the flat was a great base but not a great place if you intend to hang out at home and cook etc...  Perfect for what we were looking for.  The value was excellent and I would recommend it to anyone.
Thank you Elizabeth.

The room has a million dollar view. There are only very few places in London where you get to see green space as far as your eyes can see. Perfect for those who are into a wanderlust in beautiful Richmond Park. I've lived in London before and I know all too well how this city can be overwhelming, at times stressful. Get your dosage of serotonin here. Stay sane, seriously."

J'ai eu la chance de pouvoir partager de nombreux repas avec eux  et même pu goûter à quelques un de leurs plats (Ce sont de très bons cuisiniers !).

C'est bien la première fois que je tombe sur des gens aussi accueillants et marrants (vraiment, ce sont d'excellents comiques ! ;)), ils seront toujours là pour égayer vos journées. De plus, ils sont aussi de bons conseils concernant les endroits à visiter dans Londres et si vous avez besoin de quoi que ce soit ils sont se rendent toujours disponibles. 

En ce qui concerne la chambre elle est tout à fait conforme aux photos et très bien équipée (très propre avec des rangements).

Je ne les remercierai jamais assez pour cet accueil si chaleureux. Vous ne serez pas déçus ! 

I just came back from 3 months in London at Giovanni and Denis' house who have been incredibles hosts, I passed only great moments with them. I have been lucky by sharing some mealtime with them and even tasted some of their specialities (they defenitely know how to cook !).

This is the first time that I bump into this kind of people, they have been so welcoming and funny (they are comical ;)), they always will be there to make your day better. Moreover, they have good advices relating to some places where you could go in London and if you need anything, just ask they will do everything they can to help.

About the pictures of the room, they match with the reality. The room is very comfortable and well furnished (very clean).

I don't know how to thank them, they have been so good to me. You won't be disapointed !"

I tend to be a bit antisocial and was left to my own devices which I really liked but I think Marcia is available for interaction if you fancy a chat. She was lovely to speak to when we met briefly. The house is in a nice quiet spot really convenient for everything I will definitely be staying there again."

Great location for O2 arena - about 20 - 30 mins walk depending on your speed or easy bus ride. Also good for Greenwich area in general."

24113728,410594201,10/02/2019,31159774,Melissa,"Convenient location within walking distance to lots of restaurants and the Borough Market. Convenient to  the Underground.  Being that it is in the city, you can expect noise.  There were sirens and the clock down the street chimes .   I used a white noise app and ear plugs. The shower was a challenge. There is a large step up to get in the shower.  The water is heated with a boiler that is not consistent and allows the water to get dangerously hot. We had internet issues and Lisa was great about communicating  with us and trying to resolve the problems."
199658,29253858,06/04/2015,25003480,Michelle,"Patrick est très disponible et réponds extrêmement vite à toutes les questions, de même qu'Alexandra. L'appartement est très bien placé, le métro est proche et un grand supermarché permet de faire ses courses même très tard le soir. Il donne sur une cour très tranquille et le voisinage de l'hôpital m'a fait peur mais il n'y a pas d'ambulance....pas de bruit nocturne. Si on ne veut pas cuisiner il y a plein de petits restaus pas trop chers à 5 min à pied."

17587652,189033456,31/08/2017,85478473,Andrey,"Stayed for two and a half months. Great value for price, especially in London. The room looked good, was clean and quite spacious. The apartment has a fully functional kitchen with all the necessary equipment and a toilet that was kept clean and working well. It's a 30 minutes walk away from the city and has at least two relatively big supermarkets nearby. In general, throughout my whole stay, had no major issues resulting from anything that had to do with the room or apartment. In case of any questions, Amanda and Maria were very accessible and very quick to answer. Overall, it was a nice and comfortable stay!"

28753373,567755928,23/11/2019,6516935,Michael,"Nice room with private bath, very quiet, everything spotlessly clean. The area is nice with good pubs and restaurants, and it is very close to the river. Well connected by bus, South Kensington is 20 minutes walk."
6503029,62198004,12/02/2016,43322529,Stewart,As good a stay as aswells even when the lights went out in the whole area. Thankfully it only lasted 20 mins and Dawn was on hand with torches and candles.

19241945,347974929,12/11/2018,17925818,Eirini,"Ali was a very well organized host and the communication with him was perfect.
The best thing about the apartment was that it was super clean and tidy.
It was also situated in the most beautiful district of London and near tube stations and the price was logic. We really enjoyed the view which was what attracted us most from the pictures. It was warm, with lots of USB ports and a couple of adapters and Wifi  worked perfectly. 
It has large windows with curtains but no shutters . However this was not a problem for me as I had a sleep - mask with me.
The only thing that was missing was a more homy feeling. There could be some coffee  or tea for us to make or some  decorations. 
Otherwise it was a lovely room and we would defenitely choose it again when we come to London as we enjoyed living in that area very much."
10130209,108791095,17/10/2016,23825322,Hilda,Our stay with Markito was a very pleasant one.  The apartment is located very close the the underground  so it is very easy to get anywhere in the city from there. Markito was a lovely host who was always willing to answer questions and give us directions.

We exchanged a few messages ahead of our stay so I felt comfortable with all the arrangements and was really looking forward to the stay.  The house and garden really surpassed my expectations and the overall atmosphere was warm and welcoming.  The furniture and decoration were so lovely and unique that it was a real privilege to stay there. 

My party ranged in age from 6 months to 60+ and the house was well set up for all of us.  The kitchen is really well equipped and there was plenty of room for family meals.  Forest Hill is a lovely area of London to be based in, particularly for families as there are lovely parks and the Horniman museum nearby."

We had a lot of places to be during our time there, and the tube was just around the corner. The local food shops were also a plus, and we took advantage of cooking in most mornings and several evenings. Julian was very responsive to our questions and needs. He had several terrific restaurant suggestions for us. (We especially loved Hally's for breakfast.) Another thing that really helped was having a washer/dryer on site - we hit an unusually hot period of time and had packed light, so we needed to do laundry several times. "
9674577,142268890,07/04/2017,56730228,Michał,"The apartment is located in very nice place in central London, very close to Oxford Street. Jomar was very helpful. He arranged pick-up (extra charge, but the price is quite good) from Stansted Airport for us. When we arrived to the apartment, the manager welcomed us and she walked us around the apartment. There are great equipped kitchen and living room. Bedrooms are quite nice. One thing which was bad surprise was ""late check-in fee. Anyway this is very good place for short stay like business trip."

We both slept well as it is a quiet neighbourhood and the beds are comfortable. Also, the location is very convenient...buses, trains and taxis close by - but not too close!!

Everything was clean, and the location was great - just a few minutes walk from the tube station. Dan was a great host and responded to all my questions within minutes. The area was a bit noisy due to traffic, planes and construction work, but this is to be expected in London and is out-with the hosts control. I would happily recommend this apartment and would stay again. Good value for money."

24408576,488509985,15/07/2019,251074927,O,Big and comfortable ! We enjoyed staying Kasia’s appartement. The only flaw was the noise of the trains. 위치도 좋고 집도 되게 넓고 세탁기 주방 모두 다 잘 구비 되어 있어요. 차랑 커피 등 많이 많이 있고.. 호스트 두명도 모두 친절하구요 ㅎㅎ 진짜 딱 하나의 단점이 아파트 바로 옆에 철도가 있어서ㅠ 기차 소음이 크게 들린다는거.. 근데 창문 다 닫고 자면 방음 잘돼요. 다 닫고 있으면 조용해요. 아무튼 전반적으로 좋았습니다.

The appartement got everything you need (probaply more then you‘ll find in other appartements). We really enjoyed to prepare are own breakfast, the dishwasher is a huge plus. Angel underground is really close, a lot of restaurants and pubs you‘ll find within a 5 min walk. I would go there again without any doubt."

16015132,149023351,02/05/2017,80744972,Louise,Enjoyed our stay at Nina & James . Myself and my partner booked a 3 nights stay. A couple of days before we arrived Nina messaged to say herself and James had decided to go away for the weekend so we had the place to ourselves. Nina was very good with communication and very helpful in giving us advice  about what we needed to know. The place is as described the only thing I didn't like was the spiral staircase is steap but that's just because I'm not good with heights. Having the swimming pool right outside the door is fantastic it's cold when you first get in but then it's ok . The bed is really comfortable and the bathroom is straight across from the bedroom . Around the corner from the apartment there is a tesco express a few other shops and take away places and it's also where we caught the bus. Nina and James came back Sunday I only got to see James for a couple of minutes due to work but Nina is a lovely woman who was happy to chat with us and made us feel welcome . Nina and James went to their room they were tired after a long day but told us not to worry about making a noise because they wouldn't hear us . We didn't feel uncomfortable at all . Lovely place and lovely couple

17536221,143604068,12/04/2017,61406110,Rafael,"This place is amazing, first you will have a large room for you and your roommate. Second, the family-like environment of the house will make you feel more like staying in a friend's place, rather than renting a room. Third, the neighbourhood has everything that you need, literally, from Italian restaurants to 24h shops. Finally, the subway will take you to the centre in 40-45 min at a price of 2.70£ (actually cheaper than other closer Airbnb options that have higher prices due to the bus connections you need to take).

The underground and buses were just a few blocks away and took us to all the places we wanted to go.   The flat was large and comfortable with basic amenities plus tea and coffee. The washing machine was a benefit and enabled us to pack light for the trip. The neighborhood is urban with great restaurants, pubs, coffee shops, and a nice Co-op grocery store nearby. Jason was a fantastic host and greeted us when we arrived. He had lots of great tips for our stay and was super nice and accessible if we had any questions. I highly recommend this Airbnb!"
35022529,463425725,03/06/2019,139277655,Lindsay,Definitely a good place to stay if you want more of a hotel vibe than staying in an apartment. The place was great and the washer and dryer was awesome to have. Super close to the train which made it very easy to get into the city.

We found it quite clean, acknowledging that my wife loves cleanliness. It was a good point for us. I think it's the most spotless AirBnB place I've ever stayed.

We barely used public transport because we walked everywhere due to all the brilliant sightseeing surrounding the area. Love St Catherine Docks, a true Gem.
On our check-out, Danni allowed us to leave our luggage in his safe storage. It is a kind gesture from him, that helps very much

Ottima la comunicazione con Alex che ci ha anche dato buoni consigli su posti per bere e mangiare. La posizione del appartamento è strategica a 10 min da Liverpool street e perfetta per girare l'East, vero cuore della Londra più viva, a due passi da Brick Lane e Shoreditch. La notte può essere un po' movimentata in quella zona e la stanza è leggermente luminosa ma sono a disposizione sia tappi che mascherine. Consigliato vivamente per un short stay a Londra!!"

The neighborhood is wonderful, quiet, but not far from the vibrant life of east London. Nice café´s and pubs are nearby, same for busses and overground to the city and other parts of London. The room with its own bathroom is lovely, same for the wonderful renovated whole victorian house. Hilary is a wonderful host, easy to communicate with, helpful and very hospitable.

If everything was all good at first sight, the cleaning happened to be rather superficial and there's a strong humidity smell. We will remember the best of

As my friend had never used Airbnb before, she was especially suprised and happy everything went well.

Also possible to walk to the different attractions, if you like walking and most especially, not far from Camden Town."

A 5 minutes à pieds du métro ""Tooting Broadway"" qui est  situé à côté d'un supermarché, pratique en rentrant le soir! Impasse très calme, 3ème étage sans ascenseur (sans problème pour nos jeunes jambes, peut-être moins agréable pour des personnes âgées). Appartement propre et clair. Linge de lit et serviettes de bain de bonne qualité. Je recommande sans hésiter."

We were staying at the house for my sister's hen do and she was literally over the moon with how gorgeous it was. It so important to make a hen memorable, and Debbie was so helpful in letting me organise a really special day - she even ordered new plates for us as we were having a dinner party! 

On to the house - it's SO rare to find such a stunning, large house in central London on airbnb. The kitchen and garden are amazing spaces to socialise, and all the rooms are extremely comfortable. There are lots of nice little touches too, like a kettle in the rooms. 

Highly, highly recommend! 

Thanks again, Debs!!"

Her and Maurice are so welcoming and fun to talk to, and their Airbnb is perfect for a visit to London!  It is extremely close to the tube, and the area around their home has many great restaurants and groceries.  If you are looking for a place in London, you MUST pick this Airbnb, it is perfect!  Not to mention she was kind enough to lay out breakfast breads, cereals, coffee and tea each morning!  A wonderful experience all around!"

The flat, and the accommodation were perfect, but when I take an airbnb with people I like have a little bit exchange. I saw Eleni one time in the 3 days, and the last night (when I need to sleep!!!) she made noise all the night."

We found a great little tapas bar with a secret bar area downstairs called the confessional hidden behind a mirror we loved it!

And the room is exactly the picture that you can see from the web. It's not big but it's very comfortable and the bed which we lie down with two person and it still have a lot of space. All you need is all in the apartment and the most important is the good location that we actually live by the metro and you don't hear any noisy.

Jennifer was very kind and helpful, quick to reply to my queries and very accomodating to my short notice booking and my requirement for somewhere to securely lock a bike.

The location was great for access to the main tube lines and there were many options for eating and convenience nearby.  The neighborhood is very nice and the Flat location was very quiet.  The apartment was very clean and the three bathrooms were a welcome feature for our party.  While the Flat is small we did not feel like we were lacking for space!  Alessandra was welcoming and made things seamless for our trip allowing us to check in slightly early due to our flight arrival.  As noted, there are many narrow stairs, to and in the Flat but we were able to manage just fine even with our luggage however it may be difficult for those with mobility issues.  All in all it was a great stay for our time in London!"

The flat is on a nice quiet street but very close to Portobello Road so you're not far from the market, restaurants and cinemas. Two tube stations and plenty of buses also in very close proximity so getting around was a breeze. The flat was clean and very comfortable, with everything needed for a lovely experience.

The  flat equipped with everything like staying at your own home. Neil was thoughtful and great in communication with us too. He prepared milk, fruit and flower upon our arrival. Also helped to print out online tickets for Windsor and Buckingham Palace. The price was same as that of 5 star hotels but it was deserved! "

28246570,366315471,02/01/2019,18177216,Tiziana,"We checked in at 4 pm and the house was completely dirty. We contacted the host, I made 5 phone calls and I spoke with 5 different people. At 7 pm nobody was able to give me a precise answer on what to expect. Me, the other couple and the 4 kids waited for 3 hours outside the house waiting for the cleaners to arrived. One person arrived at 7.30 and when she saw the bad situation of the house ( dirty and messy all over the places) she called her friend to help. They finished cleaning at 23.30 and only at that point we have been able to enter the apartment. No way! 
Second the heating was too low and it was freezing! 
Third we left a Bose speaker in the kitchen and after 10 days I still don’t know what is going if I will receive it back or not, unbelievable! 
Not happy at all for the service! The house was nice."

The place is spatious with good river view.  however, please beware that the two beds in the two bedrooms are set on high platforms (maybe 1.5 meter high) and don't have bed rails around it. So children can't sleep there. 
The gas cooktop and gas oven are a little bit tricky to operate: you have to hold the button long enough to establish a steady flame.  It would be good if there is small instruction note for people like me. "

But it often doesn't take very long and the price is just great for this location. The place is surprising new and clean, with many lovely snacks. The self-checkin was pretty smooth.

Sarah made us all feel very welcome and we weren't stressed out having little kids exploring the house. We even had a Christmas tree waiting for us. The house is located 5 minutes from a busy street with lots of nice independent stores (which were unfortunately closed over the Christmas period) and a lovely bookshop."

We spent most of our day out exploring and only needed the room to sleep and refresh. It was very comfortable, secure, and in a very accessible part of the city where you could choose to walk to most places if you wanted to.

We really enjoyed our stay there and would definitely recommend this place to other people visiting London."

16994407,141216897,02/04/2017,78144469,Jack,"What more can we say other than this place is the BEST! Maddy and Stu have such a lovely flat and they make you feel at home from the second you walk through the door. The room is spacious, bright, very tastefully decorated and immaculately clean. We were met with a vase of fresh flowers, a pack of biscuits and some sweets - little attentions to detail like this made them such a joy to stay with. We loved coming back to our room at the end of every day, it felt like our home for the time with stayed their.
The location is perfect - under a ten minute to either branch of the northern line, right near the overground and surrounded by heaps of buses. It was so easy to get around the city. There are lots of nice things within walking distance too such as Camden Markets, lots of bars/restaurants and the beautiful primrose hill. 

We've stayed in many parts of London before and this is by far our favourite area and our best experience with any air b'n'b/hotel.

Thank you both so much for everything. We really hope we get a chance to stay with you again some time.

All the best, Jack and Francoise."

The location is amazing- a 3-5 min walk to Earl's Court Station and less than 1 min to the main street with shops and restaurants. It only took me about 20-30 minutes to Central London and further east areas, which went by super fast on the metro and even via bus! Sebastian was a superb host and easy to communicate with. 

Two notes for anyone booking- the flat is on the basement level, so you go down a small flight of stairs. If you have heavy 50lb luggage like I did or bad knees, just consider this as it can make it a bit difficult.  Also, the front entrance door is kind of tricky to open, I mentioned this to Sebastian so he'll be looking into it. Just be cautious of your fingers! :] "

The bus stations are closer.. but making sense of the London bus service isn't the easiest so I was often walking further to the trains. My only problem was when I first arrived at the apartment after a long flight and my surprise at the apartment being on the 4th floor with no elevator access. Having to drag a large suitcase up all those stairs is not the easiest. So I wouldnt recommend this for anyone who has disabilities or is carrying lots of luggage. Other than that it was a nice little apartment (No real kitchen area, but they made up for that with a table with tea, coffee and microwave laid out nicely, but the only running water taps are in the bathroom as there is no built in kitchen sink) easy to communicate with the host and I had no problems. Would be geat for people just stopping by for a few nights with light luggage. "

2476083,467411921,10/06/2019,98769030,Naomi,"Russell’s quaint flat was just as described and Russell himself an exceptional host- meeting us and showing us through the flat and offering local tips and even left us a welcome gift which was a very thoughtful touch and well appreciated after a day of long travels. 
The flat is very close to public transport; walking distance to Angel and easy to get to St Pancras/Kings Cross also. Plus plenty of buses about in nearby streets.
The flat was clean and very homely and lovely and bright with big windows; the rooms are quite big and the beds are super comfy as are the bed linens provided - very snuggly. 
Not noisy even thought it’s faces a street, so very sound proof for light sleepers. 
I also love that the place has real indoor plants in lounge room and plants on the patio- a bit of greenery creates a lovely ambience to the flat and takes away that sterile environment some AirBnb’s have with the minimalistic look. 
Also it has a building lift which is wonderful if you have lots of luggage like we did. 
Has a good working washing machine which we used and drying racks provided. 
The only negative was the pub across the road was under renovation and had to walk to another pub down the road! But having a supermarket in such close proximity was a bonus. 
Highly recommend this place. Good value and has all the comforts of home a traveler would need. Clean, comfortable & spacious. Would stay again for sure."

There was garbage left in the desk from a previous guest and the bathroom was not the cleanest. The bath tub was often dirty. However, I would stay here again if I did come back to London."

Me ajudou muito em informações relacionadas a meus deslocamentos na cidade de Londres e também me auxiliou muito em deslocamentos que precisei fazer entre outras cidades.

Sua casa reflete exatamente aquilo que é falado no site e é mostrado na foto; muito aconchegante, limpa e organizada. Situa-se em um bairro residencial calmo e tranquilo, e dormir naquela casa traz uma paz muito agradável.

A casa está a cerca de meia hora do centro de Londres (por metrô) e o deslocamento é muito fácil, tranquilo e agradável.

Foi um imenso prazer ficar na casa de Judith, vou sentir saudades desses dias e eu repetiria essa experiência com toda certeza."

Very nice: we arrived early and wanted to leave luggage till late: both was no problem! Great! The neighbourhood is very hip and happening: right on spot with bars cafe's, dancings and restaurants. Book this place for the location! Recommendable! Rental cycles (Boris Bikes) and bus and metro around the corner. Room is simple, not luxurious but everything's there.  Bed sleeps very well. "

The flat is also a 5 minute walk to Chalk Farm tube stop, so it is extremely well connected. Steve was a very generous host--he responded to messages quickly and tried his best to accommodate our needs. If you are looking for a flat in a lively area with easy access to central London, Steve's flat would be ideal."

The linen had hairs on it. Luckily, I had my own and could use it instead. Also, the flights of stairs up to the loft were a bit much, especially with luggage.

Rooms and the bathroom upstairs are very practical and the living room and kitchen are well equipped.  The arrival is very well explained and easy to access.  Buses are closer to the apartment than the train.  We preferred the buses, it allowed us to see a little more the city.  The shops are close to apartment, it's really very convenient.  I will definitely return because we loved this beautiful place."
21108118,531336504,17/09/2019,265058078,Rory,While it’s a small space it was very clean and cozy. The stairs weren’t an issue and all cooking needs were covered. Polina was very responsive to any questions. Easy walk to underground and basic shopping. For a no frills resting place this fit our bill completely. Would certainly recommend it.

I've got to mention though if we pay for a cleaning fee the host should then take that in consideration. The sponge used to wash the dishes looked older than me and the bath tub had lots of hair inside... Those are the only bits I think the host should improve for the next time. 
However I did not regret choosing this room since I mainly look into cheap& good location for short stays!"

2569427,23658703,07/12/2014,10196038,Manish,"It's a very nice and comfortable flat with modern amenities. I like the kitchen and the bathroom. I could not get the TV to work, but maybe I was doing something wrong. The WiFi worked great.

The location is nice, but it's a little far from the underground--I ended up taking Uber most of the time.  Danny did not meet me personally, but he left the keys in a convenient location for me. I liked the flat, but there are a few things that are not mentioned in the listing that I think I would have liked to know:

* It is a basement flat. I prefer upper flats because they have more light and are quieter. This one is a little dark, but the interior lighting is nice enough.

* It is on a pretty busy street with a lot of vehicle traffic. Combined with the fact that it is a basement flat, you will hear cars driving by all night unless you close the bedroom door, in which case the road noise is significantly diminished.

Everything was fine with my stay and it is a very nice flat, but if I had known it was a basement I may not have selected it. As long as you don't mind basement flats, however, it should be just fine--the price was good and it was comfortable. :)"
20628771,332928830,06/10/2018,135631176,Thomas,"Neville is a very friendly and straightforward host. Communication during our stay was perfect. We could even leave our bags in the flat after check-out until we left for the airport.
The access to public transport is very good. The apartment is located a 5 min walk from Cambridge Heath Overground Station and to the next bus stop. 15 mins to Bethnal Green Underground Station.
Neville's apartment is perfect if you want to visit London for a few days. It is clean with a fully equipped kitchen (even though we didn't cook). Although it is rather simple it's perfectly alright considering the fair price!"
25559908,419013360,03/03/2019,40957619,Sergio,Localización muy buena. Precio económico si lo único que necesitas es una cama para dormir. Contento con la estancia.

And I'm saying that in spite of the fact that something broke in the bathroom during my stay. Just bad luck. Yes, sometimes shit happens...
But Peter moved mountains to fix it as soon as possible. Thanks a lot for that!
It's great because it's quiet, super clean, located in a cool district (shoreditch / bethnal green) and with easy access to any place in London via bus or underground.
It's a perfect small self-contained place. What I liked most is the attention to the details. Coffee, fruits, water, butter, marmalade and many other small things you need for a simple breakfast were in the fridge. 
I highly recommend it and believe it's one of the best value-for-money listings in London."

14760330,285244531,03/07/2018,117924623,Marlene,"My two friends and I stayed in this apartment last week and we had a great time. The location is ideal for friends looking for a lively, fun atmosphere. There are loads of stores, open air markets and restaurants nearby. The location could not be more ideal for sight seeking as well.  Our favorite place to frequent was the Spitalfields market, especially on Sunday when tons of vendors come out and sell foods from around the world. The apartment itself was clean and stocked with necessities. We absolutely appreciated the washing machine once we figured it out. This place is not ideal for people wanting a quiet retreat. As for me and my friends, we enjoyed the sounds of the city and were not bothered by the occasional rowdy bunch of people below our living room window. The only thing that would make this place better would be to replace the aging carpet in the hallway and flat with wood flooring or laminate, which  would be a cleaner and updated look. Other than that one idea, I loved this place and I would rent it again."
12151836,74351336,15/05/2016,20302954,Narjiss,Tatiana is an amazing host. The apartment was exactly the same as described and the area is very cool  and nice. I would definitely recommend !

Daniel , and Housekeeping staff were very responsive, and helpful when we got stuck in London due to COVID19.  Our room was small, but well appointed. There is some noise-transfer, but this really wasn't an issue.  Clean, safe neighbourhood, with Tube Stations, train, and great grocery store closeby.  We look forward to another stay!"

I stayed for 4 nights with my husband during Notting Hill Carnival & it was the perfect location, close enough to enjoy the atmosphere but an oasis of calm to retreat to when it got a bit much!  It is in a very safe area with great shops, bars & restaurants within walking distance.  The apartment was as exactly as described & it was lovely to have some outdoor space to enjoy a coffee in the morning.
Jacqui was a great host & responded quickly to any queries.  I would definitely recommend staying here & I hope to be able to stay again the next time I am in London."

Paul was very knowledgeable with respect to what to do and see around the area and London in general. Would 100% recommend this spot to anyone looking to get a central spot that’s not as costly as the other central options.

The house was as described and Dave was incredibly welcoming, knowledgeable and friendly (Karen was out of town). We were always offered tea, good conversation, and advice for getting around town. The beds were very comfortable and Dave’s breakfast is delicious! Greenwich is a very beautiful and quiet town, which is a nice change of pace from the hustle and bustle of London. I would definitely recommend staying with Dave and Karen to anyone! "
34797251,567040692,21/11/2019,135857096,David,Lisa was a wonderful host who made sure her communication was top notch. I felt like I was home. It was a perfect area too where I felt safe and all our needs were very close to the location of this Airbnb. My wife and I will definitely be staying here again if we come to London.
6381940,67438968,29/03/2016,52794911,Talia,"What an amazing and incredibly generous host, beautiful house + cute cat! 

My partner and I have just relocated from Australia and stayed here for a month, we were able to settle quickly largely due to Nigel and his home.

The flat has great transport links and is within walking distance to everything you would ever need...But the real sweetener is Nigel!
He was so lovely from beginning to end, from meeting/helping us with our bags to helping us find jobs! 
The space is beautiful, and comfortable for two people and having our own bathroom was a bonus. 

Thanks for everything Nigel, we are looking forward to catching up over a beer in the future mate! "
24727384,655402865,23/08/2020,358778805,Gala,Very nicely furnished apartment in a great location for night life. But isn’t very soundproof as could hear the neighbours and other guests walking around and the doors closing throughout the night. Would recommend for people who like staying out very late as opposed to a quite stay in.
10540797,346613735,09/11/2018,218901949,Margie,"This is a very well situated airbnb. The host was fantastic with her communication. the flat has large sunny windows; good living space and all the amenities you need to make your stay comfortable. It is very convenient in a great area. Lots of stairs if you have large luggage, and the traffic noise is loud at night."
3984926,311017926,20/08/2018,98873891,Sidney,"Laurent gave us a very warm welcome. He prepared water, drink, milk upon our arrival. The apartment is in nice neighborhood and convenient location. We can walk to farm, park and convenient stores. We had to make some transfer to our destination. But the buses are very frequent, so we were ok with transfers.  The beds were too hard for our taste. To sum up, it was a good stay."
8452672,208199308,31/10/2017,118800090,Colin,Julian is a nice friendly guy. Had a pleasant stay. Took the booking on short notice which really helped me out. Thanks Julian.
23847732,483341262,07/07/2019,48282420,Matt,"Very easy check-in procedure with great communication. The house was quite old, but the bedroom area had newer amenities and felt quite clean. Shari was helpful with checking in and communication, and all of her (Hidden by Airbnb) were available to help with any questions or concerns we had throughout our stay.

If you're a light sleeper, keep in mind that the window for this room faces Brick Lane, so during the summer months when you will want to sleep with the window open, there will be a lot of street noise."
32760549,519742162,29/08/2019,250370673,Tatyana,"We travel with my friend and our staying in Mike's place was perfect! Mike was hospitable, communicative and very kind! He provided us with everything that was needed even washing powder, hair dryer, socket adapter, towels and cooling fan! Kitchen has everything you need. Everything was clean! Location is amazing! Bus stops near the house and you may reach the centre in 40 minutes. Also you may get there by underground faster, it is about 7 mins walking to Manor Station and 13 mins to Finsbury Park Station, but we like travel by bus, it was more interesting. Mike wasn't intrusive but he answered all our questions and easily maintained dialogues. We enjoyed our conversations with him. We will happy to come back again! Thank you, Mike!"

A great host and lovely space."

17521545,320813510,09/09/2018,62681119,Niels,A nice little apartment with a good room solution for its size. Nice roof top garden. Owner should consider providing  room for guests to put clothes in closets and on hangers without restrictions. Overall impression: Slightly too expensive for what you actually get.

Easy access to buses also. The room is big enough with a comfy bed and overlooks a quiet garden. Ali is very helpful and respectful. Highly recommend."

We enjoyed coffee and food at the Brixton markets which is a really colourful place to hang out in Brixton. The flat itself has everything you'd want for a stay in London, it has great views and we found it a comfortable place to relax after the intensity of London. It is good value and Imad is a very responsive and helpful host. "
20569349,275083781,10/06/2018,114063036,Tania,"The great flat is bright and beautiful. The most comfortable is that you feel like you are in your own flat, because the apartment is  big and well cut that  privacy is guaranted. There is a private bathroom next to the room and you can Ide the Kirchen if you like. There are many restaurants&bars around, nur this Street is  quite.

However, the WiFi only worked in the side of the room closest to the door, as soon as you got on the bed you lost connection. The TV worked though so we were able to entertain ourselves with that. The bathroom was beautiful and functional. It was a bit hard for us to find the place at first because the number of the building isn’t visible, but you must speak with the shop owners I order to get the key and they show you where the door is. You are able to smell the food from downstairs really strongly since it is right on top of a restaurant."

2655695,245025678,20/03/2018,39936979,Ann,"What a difference good communication makes ... We stayed at the Muse Haus for the third time, but since we had a number of queries, we were sorry  to experience poor communication from the team, and this is why we give a lower score this time around. Some of it may be down to Airbnb's app not updating, but unfortunately, nobody was able to answer a rather simple question in a timely manner.
Apart from that, we still like the easy check-in procedure and the location. But the general feel of the 'Haus' is that it could do with some TLC from the owner."

26893937,315948007,30/08/2018,202586924,Muzzammil,"Junior is a brilliant host. His place is a small but homely studio, which has been converted from a garage, into a home dwelling. It's spacious enough for one to two people but I think your struggle to have a third person. The area is fantastic, very upper middle class and safe, with beautiful surroundings. In terms of driving, only 30 mins from the city via the Blackwell tunnel and also very close to amenities such as those in Greenwich. Very safe area and lots of local pubs and places to eat out, for those with a car this area would be ideal. 

The flat is clean and neat and junior does go all out with providing toiletries etc. i would recommend this place and junior as a good host!"

Walking distance to the tube, to beautiful Lower Marsh street and market, to Eye of London, Aquarium and many many other attractions! Just down the house there’s a bus stop going to Picadilly etc.. This is very central, and therefore some rooms may have more noise than others. This was not a problem for us, we (i was traveling with my kid) slept well, but it is good to know about it if you are sensitive to noise. The rooms are on top of a beautiful and welcoming café, decorated with a lot of taste and love by Sarah, serving a great tasting coffee (among other things). The bathroom was shared, but we never came across the other guests as we were leaving early. There is also a kitchen and fridge etc.. She provided a map and useful tips, i would return there without hesitation. Thanks for everything Sarah!!"

Francesco was a very nice host who made our stay very comfortable and pleasant. The handing over of the keys were uncomplicated and we had the possibility to leave our heavy luggage in the flat on the last day until the time we leave for the train back to London Heathrow.
The flat is situated over a famous pub, but there were no noise inconvenience you heard a little bit of the traffic jam but you could close the windows (double vitrification) and have a quite calm sleep.
The rooms are very stylish and modern furnished and also clean, the size of the rooms are a little bit smaller than expected, but if you are in the appartment just for sleeping everything is all right and adoptable. 
The appartment is situated right in the center of London, you can visit a lot of the attractions in walking distance.

It takes 5-15 minutes walk to get to bus stops and subway (underground) stations, but it is worth it for the quietness and neatness of the neighborhood. BTW, there are many electric adaptors in the house that can be used for phone chargers from USA.

714723,22227140,02/11/2014,5430765,Daisy,"Carolyn's little flat was every bit as cute as it seems. Comfortable and warm, it even felt spacious when there were 5 of us staying there for a short time during our stay. The awesome espresso machine was the star of the tiny kitchen, still there were an impressive amount of other appliances and cooking accoutrements that managed to fit in a non-cluttery and orderly way.    
It was clear that, though she was out of the country for the duration of our stay, Carolyn was absolutely invested in our comfort and enjoyment of London. We really appreciated her quick replies to questions and concerns. Toward the end of our stay there was a mounting concern. There was a renovation going on in the flat next to ours. Knowing she had no control over what goes on in someone else's residence, we let her know that there was jackhammering going on and the vibrations were jiggling our brains out. What do you need brains for on holiday anyway, right? She contacted the owner immediately and got us information and permission to tell the workers to move onto something less brain-jiggling while we were at home, which we did. It wasn't a perfect solution but it helped. When unexpected issues come up as they always do, it's the reaction of the host that makes the difference between a real problem and a tolerable inconvenience. We are very grateful it was the latter.  
The flat is just West of the Tower Bridge and St. Katharine docks. It was pleasant to jog from the flat around the docks to the bridge and back. Best to do that early in the morning when there are just other joggers and photographers out, rather than the throngs that flood the area during touristy times of day. There is a local coffee shop, White Mulberries, at the docks which would make a nice stop on a stroll around the area.
All in all, this flat was a great choice for us and we would stay here again.

11552205,245020803,20/03/2018,77247417,Vivien,"We stayed at Ennis‘ place for the second time and could not be happier with our experience. Right from the beginning of planning our trip, Ennis answered all of our questions right away and made sure we wouldn’t have to worry about anything concerning our accommodation. Ennis’ place is super easy to get to and is clean and tidy but still makes you feel like you’re home. The apartment is very modern and stylish and provides everything you need. The best thing about our trip was the host himself. He made our trip so special in the first place so that we specifically wanted to stay at his place again. Ennis is the most welcoming, kindest and obliging host we ever met and it was a pleasure sharing a flat with him. He will make sure you feel home and don’t miss anything on your trip besides taking care of you and making you feel welcome 24/7. We definitely want to come back as soon as possible and would love to stay with Ennis again!"

Gianluca’s cousin Paolo welcomed me and was very kind and helpful to answer all my questions and was available to me. He was also deep cleaning when I got there and the place reflected that! Super clean and I felt safe in the area. One of the rooms doesn’t lock from inside, so if that’s important to you ask for the other room. But both rooms have a lock  on the outside so your luggage can feel secure once you leave for the day. I loved that! WiFi was also speedy. Location was decent! To get to city center in about 35- 40 min, take the 476 from Northumberland park to seven sisters station and hop on Victoria line and you can switch to whatever train you need at kings cross! There is  also another train you can hop on for one stop instead of the bus. Overall, a great place and stay!"

The flat is really beautiful, convenient, well equipped, close to lots of interesting places i.e. Little Venice or Regents Park and has got enough space for four, a vibrant area but quiet and peaceful. The backyards atmosphere is really outstanding, the beds are comfy and the kitchen equipment is professional.

The standouts for me, once you go up the initial stairs the complete flat is on one level, the 4 rooms are a good size, plenty of light, comfortable bed, a shower cubicle rather than a shower over a bath, the kitchen had everything necessary to cook and the living room has a generous table and of course wifi. I would highly recommend Chiara’s flat to anyone wishing to have a quiet enjoyable place to stay."

20582559,726774970,25/01/2021,64662755,Kourtney,"I don’t tend to leave such detailed notes but I think this flat would benefit from some constructive criticism. Although I enjoyed my stay overall, I think there are a few things that could be fixed to make me love the property and give it 5 stars. 

First off, I was very patient on arrival...  I was meant to check into the property at 3pm and was unable to enter until 4pm due to key misplacement from previous guests. I did not receive keys to the property until about 45 minutes afterwards when the property owners girlfriend was able to assist me (thank you!).

The design of the flat is beautiful with stylish interior design and is fairly spacious for a flat so close to the city. Although styled well, there are quite a few cosmetic defects within the property which the host might consider resolving before accepting more guests.

When you walk in the bedroos there are several large carpet stains as well as a huge crack in the closet mirror secured by some tape. The lighting at night is quite dark and several bulbs in the flat require replacement. Aside from the bedroom, the bathroom and tub inside in outlined in black mould stains and need to be regrouting.  The kitchen surfaces and contents were clean and the cupboards stocked with spices/condiments but require a more thorough/ deep clean as there are oils and sticky liquids stuck on the base of cupboards.

In addition to this, there were issues with hot water in showers - assuming a problem with thermostat installed as the kitchen and bathroom sinks had hot water. The Wifi was also on and off so had to restart the router on multiple occasions and was without wifi for a full day.

On the positive, the beds are very comfortable and the sofa extends which is great for lounging on the couch. There’s lovely natural light in the bedrooms and is lovely to wake up to with the windows open. The flat is also near a lot of great restaurants so great for quick Deliveroo/ UberEats orders. 

As mentioned before the flat is nice but could definitely use some serious tweaks to make this a better stay for both short and long term guests."

We had some problems but Lina tried to solve them as well as she could. It's a nice place to go with the couple. We stayed there for 4 nights and everything was perfect except the kitchennete, that these days wasn't working (Lina provide us a replacement but it didn't work really well, it was not her fault but we couldn't cook well). However I suppose that this will be fixed for future guests.

If you're planning to stay in her flat, I reccomend you the following :

-Get a map of the Muswell Hill part, indications from the buses to the home (buses to the center run 24h ).
- To close the door, before turning the key, turn the handle up (that's not as usual at least for us in our country and it was a problem at the first day because we couldn't lock the door)

In general i reccomend the flat, because it was very comfortable and we really enjoyed our stay there."

Dasha requested that we not wear shoes in the house which was not a problem at all because she provided slippers (new) which we then could take with us.  The terrace, overlooking some green space, was perfect for two people to sit and enjoy their morning coffee or relax with a glass of wine after a long day of sight-seeing.  Dasha was very quick to reply to all our questions.  She even accommodated our early arrival so we did not have to find storage for our suitcases. We would recommend Dasha's flat.

Please note it does have a few flights of stairs--so may not be the best with seniors or very small children--although mine seemed to love the layout and were constantly exploring the flat. We had some difficulty with the travel crib so ended up having the baby co-sleep. Other than that, the Nespresso coffee in the kitchen was an added plus, and very tasty. Also, it is near a jazz club, so at night there is the occasional sound of piano music, which is endearing. The flat is comfortable, well appointed, and a nice home away from home when compared to busy London."
14757410,168355685,09/07/2017,28046606,Christopher,Max and Billie are great communicators. I was here for business and had limited time to meet with any hosts and they made the entire check-in process quite seamless. The apartment itself sustained the basic amenities and was comfortable and quiet. Overall I would highly recommend this place to anyone crashing in London for a couple days who needs a place to sleep.

13075049,104017426,25/09/2016,95927230,Edna,"I really enjoyed staying in Katrin & Christoph's home. The room for Airbnb guests is on the top floor of their large, beautiful home. An attic room, it is big, comfortable, cozy, airy, light & quiet. There is lots of space & there are lovely district views. The bed was extremely comfortable. I had the best nights sleep for the two nights I stayed with Katrin than I had for the entire 3 weeks I was away from home. It is decorated tastefully & has everything you need. The bathroom was huge & there is a lot of space to put your toiletries & things. In fact it had more space than my bathroom at home! This was a relief for me as I tend not to travel lightly. 

The breakfasts were amazing, very delicious & nutricious. Katrin is a fabulous cook & makes her own bread, biscuits & bircher museli. Breakfast consisted of all the food I love, like fresh fruit, bircher museli, nuts, yoghurt, juice and Katrin made my coffee every morning, just the way I like it, a frothy weak cafe latte!

The accommodation is very well-located in a desirable and lovely residential, safe area in north London, only a 5 minute walk from beautiful Hampstead Heath & gorgeous Kenwood House. The Heath is huge & great for long walks. It is a 10 minute walk to Belsize Park tube, (which is on the northern line), a 2 minute walk to buses & the overground railway & it is near to atmospheric Hampstead and Highgate villages, with their bustling cafes and boutiques. It is also very near to Camden; a lively, vibrant area with the famous Camden market, shops, cafes, bars, restaurants and music venues like the Roundhouse and Jazz Cafe. The first morning I caught a bus direct to the West End. I got there in 30 minutes & it was a very pleasant trip. Another option to get around London, is cycling. I borrowed a bicycle from my hosts & cycled everywhere during my stay, which was fantastic! Cycling in London is safe & all routes are well-marked. You're in good company as many Londoners cycle as their preferred mode of commuting. 

Katrin and Christophe were warm and friendly and very welcoming hosts. Katrin bent over backwards to make sure I was comfortable. They were both very helpful. Katrin has lived in London for over 30 years and knows the city inside out. She gave me great local and general advice about interesting things to do, where to go, what markets, cafes & restaurants to go to. 

I could write so much more....... All in all, I loved staying with Katrin and Christoph. London is big and can be an unfriendly, intimidating place so it was wonderful staying in their warm, homely family environment. It really enhanced my stay in London. I will definitely be back!"

We used the apartment as a base to visit Mayfair, Covent Garden, Bond Street and Hyde Park; all very accessible. It is a residential area, but just off a vibrant high street with a Middle Eastern vibe, restaurant and shops. There is also a very useful Tesco Express. We booked this apartment instead of a hotel room and it was a good choice. The bed is very comfortable and the shower has good water pressure and temperature control.

At 11pm I called he didn’t pick up. I went back to the room around 3 am and he didn’t open. I called 10 times and knocked as hard as I could. Still no luck until I managed to get a guests attention around 4:30 am. I waited outside all that time. Besides that, good value for money."

Richard is a gracious and thoughtful host, who is happy to chat or leave his guests to themselves as their mood and needs dictate.

14116002,555013114,27/10/2019,55351340,Anne,"Fantastic location, super responsive host and sunshine! 

We stayed for almost 3 weeks in October, and it was so handy for daily living (Tesco Express a couple of minutes walk for fresh stir fry, sandwich and salad ingredients), plus Costa about 1 minute away! Also an easy walk just over 15 minutes into the heart of Greenwich. Less time to the main Greenwich station, and the DLR at Deptford Bridge is maybe 4 minutes (Website hidden by Airbnb) well-connected to the rest of London! 

The front entrance is slightly hidden off a main road, but the flat overlooks the other side of the building which is much more peaceful. It’s quiet, and warm without having to turn the heating on (in October). There was even sunshine flooding into the bedroom and kitchen/diner. 

We had a problem early on with the bath/shower tap - it broke. James was onto it promptly and a handyman visited and gave us a temporary fix so we could use it until he got a replacement part to fix it properly a day later. 

We were travelling with our baby and it was a little bit of a hassle being up a flight of stairs with the pram, but that was just our circumstances and everything else made up for it. It was easy to manage and work around hazards for baby at the flat too. 

Highly recommended place to stay, especially if you’re looking to stay for more than a couple of days."

In the day I came to London there was a strike in subway, and Ruthie sent me good instructions, how can I get to her place. 
The location is very good and house is right next to the bus station, so It is impossible to get lost. District is so lovely, with small nice houses. I was impressed. It is 10 minutes walk to the Finsbury Park and same subway station. It is very easy to get by this line to airport and to the center of London.

In the morning Ruthie met me in the kitchen with a pancake. She helped me to find places that I wanted to visit, good cheap caffe and place where I can do some shopping. 

Room is very nice. Bed is good and it is pretty quiet. I was able to use kitchen to cook if needed that was important for me. 

I hope I will go to London again and I'll be able to stay there again. And I will advice it to all my friends.

Al’s place was extremely close to train station though which was very helpful (literally 4 min walk) but did come across a few suspicious / shady looking people that approached me and made me feel uncomfortable (asking for money, cigarettes etc). 

Few areas could use a good clean (toilet especially) and a somewhat odd smell in bedroom / apartment overall. 

Al (the host) was extremely friendly, great communication, and easy to deal with. He allowed me to do a late check in (almost midnight) as my flights were delayed and customs was a nightmare, which was very appreciated.

Great breakfast / coffee place down the road called ‘Grounded’ - must try if you’re in the area."

When I arrived she gave me a quick tour and let me know how to work the shower and showed me where to find things in the kitchen
I would definitely stay again"

Looking for a host who will not be pressuring you to check out early .If you want good comfortable beds. A place to park a car .This is your place .  kitchen a little small but big enough to cook should you want too .  Only negative is tiredness of furnishings but nothing that will spoil your stay . Good value for London stay . I would book again .

Her communication was fantastic, and she answered any questions immediately. She met us as soon as we got there and she was incredibly flexible about our check-in and check-out times. We loved our room and it had everything we needed. Toni was kind enough to leave bottles of water, tea, coffee, snacks, and a bottle of Prosecco for our honeymoon! This is most definitely one of our favourite Airbnb experiences, and we were a bit sad to leave!!!"

Asunnon sijainti alueella oli todella kätevä, ja siitä oli myös erittäin hyvät yhteydet etenkin Shoreditchiin ja Lontoon keskustaan. Hackneyn alueella ihan asunnon lähellä oli runsaasti kivoja kahviloita, ravintoloita ja baareja sekä muita palveluita. Asunto itsessään oli tilavampi kuin odotin - kaksi ihmistä majoittuu mukavan väljästi, sillä asunnossa on isot erilliset olohuone, makuuhuone ja keittiö. Kaiken kaikkiaan Thomasin asunnon hinta-laatusuhde oli erittäin kohdillaan, joten suosittelen sitä ehdottomasti!"

The neighborhood is so quiet yet hard to find a grocery store but there's Tesco 1 or 2 stop away by tube. Public transit is usually 5- 10 mins away.

There are a lot of reasons why I loved here. 

First, host Lavina and Paul are very nice host :-) 
Their response is quick. And They gave me information about trains and neighborhood. Also Paul helped me carrying my luggage. 

Second, room is very big and well furnished. 
Bed was really big and Bedding are super cozy. 
There are many closets to store clothes.
There are also big towels, tv, lamp, etc.. 

Also I could use nice equipped kitchen. I made my own food and ate it :-) 

Thrid, nice transportation. 
Bnb is near from South ealing and Ealing broadway tube. Also as there are many buses near the bnb, I could take a bus to station. 
It was quite easy to take central, district, piccadilly line :-) 

Fourth, Nice neighborhood.
There were many market, shops, cafe, restaurants, pub in Ealing broadway. 
But as the place where bnb is located is quite noisy, I could sleep very well. 

You dont have to hesitate, just book right now :-) 
I hope to come back :-) 

정말 좋은 집이었습니다 ^^ 고마워요!"

The whole home is immaculate.
In the back area of Streatham so its a quiet suburban area and abkut 10 min walk to buses, 15 min walk to stretham hill station and 25 min bus to Brixton.
Lots of local cafes to get great coffee and brunch, nice restaurants and pubs. Local Gym is 15 min walk, parks are close too.

I have chosen to stay at John O'Mahony room because he offered free parking. When we arrived at the address his wife Masha gave us a expired parking permit and said that they will give us a valid one, but that never happened. To make things short i got a parking ticket of 130 pounds for parking without a parking permit.
The host promised to pay but every time i asked him about proof of payment he  accused me of being disrespectful. 
On the 23.09.2015 in our conversation he confirmed of paying but failed to give me proof. 
On the 29.09.2015 (the last day the ticket could be paid half 65pound) i have called the parking department and they said the ticket was not paid. I have confronted him and he admitted of lying... he continued to accuse me and he told me that because i have been disrespectful to him I have to pay my ticket. 

I have the full conversation available and this problem is on review by airbnb support.

All this time he accused me of being responsible for the ticket, but things are clear on paper ... the ticket is due to a invalid parking permit ... he could have been honest from the start... he also accused me of parking not on the premise but i have asked explicitly his wife if the car is parked correct and she said all is ok.

If she considered i have parked wrong she could have informed me.

All in all I am disappointed of the way he managed this problem.

He should understand that lies bring more lies, and the truth always comes out.

For all what I have written in this review i have proof.

The positive: 
Masha, the wife of John, on our stay was a very good host, she advised us what to visit and also gave us umbrellas. 

I consider that the problem with the parking ticket could have been very easy to resolve, it could have been a proof of high moral values, but John complicated it and disappointed us."

I booked it for my daughter who needed somewhere to stay for a couple of nights whilst she waited for her rental flat to be ready. When we picked her up a on moving day the apartment appeared very safe within an enclosed area set back from the road. My daughter said David sent her wonderfully detailed arrival instructions which was great for a young girl travelling on her own. He had also left plenty of recommendations of things to do. She said the apartment was very clean and cute and a perfect location -only 6 mins walk to Angel Station on the High street.I would definitely try and book with David next time we are down visiting.

18217142,538107587,29/09/2019,76563051,Filippo,"Debbo sconsigliare vivamente questo appartamento. L'ottima posizione (che è ottima a tutti gli effetti) non compensa i numerosi problemi che la casa presenta. 

–– Innanzitutto è più piccola di quel che sembra dalle foto e molto molto umida. 
–– L'appartamento è al primo piano e si trova sul pianerottolo appena dopo le scale; il muro che dà sul pianerottolo è sottilissimo e permette di sentire ogni persona che entra nel palazzo, con tutti i rumori del caso: dallo sbattere della porta principale fino allo scricchiolare dei gradini. Il muro che dà sull'appartamento vicino è altrettanto sottile e anche in quel caso ogni rumore sembra avvenga nel proprio appartamento. 
–– A cadenza regolare si possono sentire: 1) la metro che passa sotto al palazzo; 2) dei colpi secchi che provengono dal piano sopra e che non siamo riusciti ad identificare (per capirci, è il suono di due palle da bowling che cascano e rotolano per qualche secondo) – quest'ultimo suono è meno frequente della metro ma comunque una presenza costante, soprattutto nelle ore diurne; 3) lo scendere dei liquidi del bagno (forse) del piano superiore. 
–– Il bagno è purtroppo maleodorante, e non (!) per mancata pulizia – sospetto piuttosto problemini con le fogne. Inoltre, se si apre l'armadietto sopra al wc, si notano delle gocce di umidità che scendono costantemente (richiudetelo subito e non vi daranno fastidio). 
–– La bella finestra che si vede nelle foto non ha tende (ci sono delle tende ad hoc per oscurare la parte della camera con il letto) e quindi l'interno è potenzialmente visibile dal palazzo di fronte. 
–– Per quanto sia una cosa di poco conto, mi sento di notare anche che la doccia ha un getto abbastanza debole. 

I proprietari non gestiscono direttamente l'appartamento ma lo danno in gestione a un'agenzia terza, cosa che ha spesso dei risvolti positivi per l'ospite, ma che purtroppo ci ha riservato una brutta sorpresa al nostro arrivo: la camera non era pronta. Va detto che il problema è stato risolto abbastanza rapidamente e con un piccolo rimborso, ma difficilmente sarebbe successo con una gestione diretta. 

Noi avremmo accettato le varie mancanze se la casa fosse costata di meno, ma a fronte del prezzo abbastanza alto, non ci aspettavamo certo questa delusione. In buona sostanza, se siete in cerca di un posto in un'ottima posizione, senza grandi pretese e avete il sonno pesante, questa casa non vi deluderà, altrimenti cercate altrove."

We were very near, within blocks of restaurants and night life and tourist attractions but It was not the crazy-busy like Picadilly Circus. I did like Pucadilly Circus for what it was but I was happy to not have stayed in that area due to the gobs of people. Vishnia and her husband were more than helpful when needed but were  not in our way. Loved the flat. For two adult children and myself, it was perfect for what we used it for which was a comfortable place to stay and hang out but only for a short time while we explored London. Highly recommend!"

I find myself in contradiction because our experience before and during our stay was really good but after it was awkward and unpleasant. "

The apartment is small but has been nicely done up and the actual room you'll be sleeping in is great and has a comfy bed. The DLR and overground are less than 5 mins walk away - you'll be in trendy East London or Central London in 20 mins or less!

I must warn visitors though - the area is quite loud, perhaps we were unlucky but on the first night a resident in the apartment block was listening to very loud bassy music till gone 3 in the morning so we certainly had trouble sleeping. The second night was much better though. I recommend bringing some ear plugs just to be on the safe side.   "

Simon accepted the request very quickly and was very communicative before and during my stay. The location is great and easy access to some nice restaurants and shops.  The Clapham Junction area is pretty up-and-coming with easy access to central London. But plan for 45 min commute during rush hour. The room I stayed in is pictured in photos 15-18 and the bathroom I used was pics 12-14. I believe the owners are breeders so do expect to meet a couple young puppies while staying here. The only complaint I had was it was a bit cold at night during the winter. Simon explained that if the taps aren't closed the hot water can't go through the radiator. But even after checking and closing all the taps the radiator never got hot. Hopefully this was addressed after my stay.  Overall a great value for a place in proximity to Central London.

But you can also spend time together and have fun. The room looks exactly the same as you can see in the pictures. The area is perfect because everything is very close. Thank you for everything!

Situata in una bellissima zona nel pieno centro di Londra, a 5 minuti a piedi dalla fermata di ben due linee della metropolitana che vi porteranno senza problemi nei principali punti di Londra. Vicino alla casa vi sono negozi, bar, ristoranti e supermercati. La cucina è attrezzata con tutto il necessario per cucinare, troverete tutto quello di cui avrete bisogno e ben più di quello che ti aspetteresti di trovare in una casa in affitto. Nonostante sia situata sulla strada principale la casa è molto silenziosa e tranquilla. 
Sebastian è un host fantastico, molto gentile, disponibile, risponde nel giro di poco tempo ai messaggi, presente ed educato; c'è stato un ""problema"" con la casa durante il mio soggiorno, problema non dipendente da lui ma ""causato"" da altri, e lui è stato molto presente, rispondendo subito e cercando di fare il possibile per risolvere il problema. Sinceramente Sebastian è stato il miglior host da me incontrato finora e lo stra consiglio a tutti, è una sicurezza e un valore aggiunto al valore della casa. 
Consiglio vivamente la casa e Sebastian!!"

The location was ideal, in the heart on hackney and the closest tube line was less than a ten minute walk.

Beaucoup de bus, si vous n'êtes pas pressés vous emmène directement dans des sites stratégiques de Londres. Par contre vous êtes à bien 1/4 de marche de Hackney Center où vous prendrez un train pour récupérer le métro, ce qui fait cher en transport au final mieux vaut prendre le bus.

The only thing was that the dryer did not work as well as the lamps in my room, and carrying my suitcase up two flights of stairs was a bit of a hassle. Other than that, it was a very pleasant stay."

His house is nice, comfortable  and excellent location: 1-2 minutes to the food shop and bus stop, 6-7 minutes to the undergound. The city center is just 1 undeground stop away.
He take me to very nice 24 hours GYM and it’s about 3-4 min walk from his house.
The bed is big and very comfortable I had a very nice sleep.
I was incredibly impressed by the architecture, the transportation system, the people and the atmosphere of London. On the next trip I'll stop again at Roman’s place. 

I wish you success!"

13026225,257259274,25/04/2018,118110729,Kristine,"This apartment location is absolutely perfect!  We walked to shops, restaurants and Portabello Road. And the easy proximity to the train was fantastic! Get a 30 pound Oyster card at the Ladbroke station machine and the city of London is yours. We went everywhere and were gone all day. We only had to walk a block to the station!
The kitchen in the apartment is small but has everything you need   Bathroom sink is small but the shower is fine. 
The bed in the loft didn't work out for me  You actually are climbing up shelves - not stairs or a ladder - to the loft. I'm in great shape and I'm athletic but I wasn't comfortable climbing up and down. After trying it the first night I slept on the couch instead. If the owner actually installed a ladder, it wouldn't be a problem. 
But otherwise the place is great!"

12198477,269434675,27/05/2018,122460510,Winnie,"Absolutely loved our stay here! If you’re looking for a place that offers privacy, safety, cleanliness, convenience, and affordable pricing in London, this is the right place.

It is located within a 2 min walk from the tube station, and it’s on a direct line to/from Heathrow airport and Central London (about half way between these two areas). The arrangement offers privacy as you have the whole top floor to yourself - with a bedroom, a bathroom and an extra room with a couch, coffee/tea, tourist info brochures, etc. All rooms were clean. The neighborhood is safe and quiet, with grocery stores, cafes, and other stores around within 3-7mins walking distance. 

Paul was a gracious and accommodating host. He was kind to give us various suggestions around town, to accommodate our early check-in (had early international flights), and to even offer us a ride to our bus station in the evening of our last day there. We enjoyed chatting with him!

Highly recommended."

Located in the beautiful and cosy Island Gardens area, the location is very convenient as it's 10 mins away from the DLR station, and one stop away from Cutty Sark (heart of Greenwich), which is bustling with cool and coquette restaurants and bars (not to mention Greenwich market with its many quirky stalls and delicious bite food). The apartment itself is clean, comfortable, spacious and well-equipped with all the amenities you require. The kitchen is fully equipped so we cook one of the nights, we bought food from the local supermarket, which was an absolute treat. Anne, the host is a sweetheart and really easy to get in touch with if you need a helping hand. All in all, we’d wholeheartedly recommend staying here if you’re on the lookout for a cosy place near Greenwich."

I didn’t meet Irkali but I met his partner and she was great!
The room has a bed, a nightstand and a chair which is all you need for a comfortable sleep. It also has an en-suite bathroom which is super convenient. I would’ve loved a big mirror in the room but I managed with the bathroom mirror.

The home was just as described, if anything even more spacious than we were expecting. Our party of 5 adults and 2 toddlers were very comfortable - the two young ones were enchanted with the place, not to mention all the toys, and hardly wanted to leave. A great outdoor space for lazy morning coffees too. 

And as for the location, it was superb, very easy walking distance from so many of London's attractions. There are also tons of cafes, shops and pubs right on the doorstep. It would be hard to be more central. We would definitely recommend Val's place

There were a lot of directions for check in, but then we did not know how to get into the building and there was no direction with that. When we got there there was no toilet paper and it took too long for the host to respond so we had to go buy toilet paper which was upsetting. The host offered to reimburse me, so that was nice. The shower did not really work and I messaged the hot and she didn’t follow through with solutions. For being pricier than some of our other options it unfortunately did not exceed expectations."

44513345,666708797,21/09/2020,148115356,David,For a group  of 4-6 this is very good value for money - 3 single beds and 2 doubles in  their own  rooms. Very often  on  AirBnB the extra beds are made up  from  sofa beds or multiple beds in  the same room.  However bear in  mind you won't be in  the lap  of luxury.  It was fine for us - basically we only slept there. The host  was very good - flexible with check in times and communication was good. Location  is good if you want to  get  to  canary  wharf and travel  into  central  london is easy  on  DLR - the local  station is literally outside the house. Note that  this is a really a duplex apartment in a block. Security is good and the entrance is in  a local  market  and shopping centre which is colourful and convenient.  Local  pubs are terrible though!

The bed of the room is supper comfortable and the toilet is very clean. Roger is a pleasant and cheerful person. He prepared breakfasts for me and guide me where to visit about in the city. He even helped me to save the transport cost to Heathrow Airport by carrying my heavy luggage till the last train stop. I will definitely recommend my daughter who is studying in UK to stay his home when she spend holiday in London."

The bed was made into a super king sized bed but can be separated to two large singles if preferred and the linen was outstanding. There is plenty of hangers and storage and two very comfortable armchairs as well. The room is beautifully decorated and a lovely haven from days/ nights out.
Jon makes amazing bread, banana bread and his scones would win awards. We also shared a lovely home cooked meal with them which was extremely appreciated by us both.
Their accommodation is close to public transport and easy access into London cbd.
We also were grateful to have use of the kitchen and laundry facilities as we were staying 8 nights.
Ella and Jon are extremely welcoming and great hosts. Highly recommended Airbnb experience."

We didn't see Olivia's housemate during the stay and enjoyed the very comfortable living/kitchen area. I'd definitely stay again on another trip to London."
9743681,296740568,26/07/2018,39022313,Andrew,"I will start with positives. It is a great modern place in a good location, close to Holland Park station and great shops and restaurants.

Check in was easy. The place is very clean and having a washing machine helped a lot.

However, given the price we paid, which was close to US$500 per night (when we stayed) and more than 5 star hotels in area, we had a bad experience.

We were there 3 nights when day time temperatures reached 33 degrees  to 36 degrees celsius. The apartment is on the fourth floor and got very hot. We couldn’t sleep in the bedroom as when opened window, wind didn’t blow. So we slept on the folded out couch in living room. Unfortunately as near a hill on a semi main road opening the windows led to a huge amount of noise. The heat and noise meant we didnt sleep. 

The other issue is the neighbour apartments are not happy with Airbnb. Both on arrival and leaving apartment we were questioned whether we were Airbnb... which is fine, however, from their tone it was clear we were not welcome there. This meant we were constantly sneaking in and out of apartment to avoid neighbours.

Both these issues can be fixed. 
1. A fan would have cooled the place down. Unfortunately when we went traipsing around the city everywhere had sold out. I’m sure Conor will fix this for next time. 

2. Maybe Conor can speak to the neighbours and get them a bit more onside with Airbnb. 

Our opinion was obviously tarnished because of the heatwave. My girlfriend and I ended up having an average 3 days as hadn’t slept for 3 nights and I am writing this still a bit tired. During cooler months this review obviously won’t be relevant. 

I will finish saying Conor was lovely to deal with and I appreciate him having us."
29964169,356493830,08/12/2018,15696886,Jaison,"Great place. Close to many different types of public transportation. Easy access, but you you have any issues with stairs this is not the place for you. I loved my stay here."

Very easy to commute to central London (30-40 min). The apartment is always very clean and tidy, and the decoration is lovely. The only drawback was that the bedroom and bathroom were a bit small, so try to avoid bringing a big luggage. Jean and Nico are excellent hosts; they really try to make you feel at home. Jean is a chef so we had the privilege to be served delicious breakfast every morning, and he even woke up at 4:45am on our last day to prepare a little something before we leave for our train! They also gave us useful information on what to do and what to eat. Thank you Jean and Nico for this wonderful stay! -Chris & Ysa."

The unit had everything that one could want in terms of kitchen Washing machine, Tumble dryer, Ironing board and iron, hairdryer etc.

In fact it has everything we could have possibly needed and more - a folder with information about London and nearby shopping/sights/food/drink, high speed internet, a laptop with printer, books, music, office equipment, tape (handy for packing), adapters, extra linen, towels, and really good shampoo/conditioner/bath soap ...

It had a comfy bed, wardrobe for storage and lovely little touches. We were supplied with large bath towels and clean bedding. 

The house is lovely, bright and quirky. The interior is colourful with lots of lovely art. The kitchen is modern and has all the amenities required.

We had a wonderful stay, I would recommend booking this room with Kim for a great stay in London."

We were staying here as we had work in the area and it made for a decent place to come back to. 
A couple of issues that can be easily resolved by the host, which they now know about, but overall all, well priced and relatively central location with the benefits of free parking."

The flat was clean and modern and we had everything we could have needed. The bed was extremely comfortable and I had the best sleep that I have ever had when staying away from home. It was a real home from home.
Patty is the perfect host and keeps in good contact with you through the whole booking process  and stay.
I would definitely stay there again when visiting London and will be recommending Patty's apartment to friends."

39076390,667981233,26/09/2020,6290631,Stanislav,"The location is very good. Room was small but that’s how it was advertised. The main problem I had was the level of noise. I’m not a sensitive person in that sense but there’s a construction site right across from the window, and the window has no sound proofing whatsoever. The workers started very early and there was a lot of noise at night as well. You can literally hear everything, even people talking quietly outside, so imagine sledgehammer noises at 7am... Maybe my room was worse because it’s on the side of the street, but that was really uncomfortable."

I was visiting with some friends from America in order to celebrate New Years. We were greeted by a neighbour and a wonderful set of instructions from Yenny. 
The flat was very clean and as described, along with Christmas decorations (and even a bottle of bubbly to help us celebrate the New Year!) and a nice view of the Shard and St. Paul's from the balcony. 
I would definitely recommend and would love to stay here again next time I visit London. "

12381919,558086076,02/11/2019,6129821,Silvia,"La camera è in una posizione fantastica ed è molto silenziosa. Arredo estremamente semplice. La host fornisce molte indicazioni e molte sono le regole cui attenersi, ma in due giorni non l'abbiamo mai vista, ma solo sentita. Il meccanismo di self check-in è rischioso, perché i due vicini di casa che dovrebbero aprire la porta al posto di Isabella non rispondono al campanello: noi siamo entrati in casa per puro caso, approfittando di una persona che casualmente stava uscendo. Come segnalato da altri utenti, è impensabile offrire ospitalità senza garantire un check-in agevole per almeno 5-6 ore in una giornata."

Just don't stand up straight in the bath! It's under a sloping ceiling! Melanie was very helpful; good instructions on how to find her place, giving us some local information & printing out our 2 for 1 voucher.  Her home is in a lovely area, almost village like. It's just a minute from the river where there are several good pubs close by. We would definitely return without hesitation. Just a shout out for The Ritz Cafe along the main road. It's basically a workmens cafe but it's spotlessly clean and does one of the best cooked breakfasts we've had at a very reasonable price."

16310033,278634513,18/06/2018,169725659,Maxine,"I stayed at Laura’s for almost 3 months, if it was possible I would give her 10 stars. Laura is an amazing woman. She is super sweet, friendly and very helpful. She showed me how to take the bus here in London and what was where. Gave me excellent tips etc. 
She made me feel at home from the very first moment. 

The dogs are really sweet and cuddly. 

The room is very clean, as is the rest of the house. Laura is very respectful. If I wanted to enjoy a night by myself after a long day at work, she would respect that. 
Or when I felt like going out with friends, Laura made no fuss about it. Other nights we would watch tv together with a cup of coffee or tea. I told her once I liked watching bones and from that moment she recorded it for me so we could watch it together.
I’m really going to miss drinking coffee with her and talking for hours and watching Bones together. 

Laura really is a super host! I can’t wait to come back to London and to stay at Laura’s again. 

Laura you are amazing and I am going to miss you!"

The flat was nice, but the building was a bit iffy (as noted in the description).  We did have a few interesting experiences with ""characters"" in and around the property, but overall did not feel unsafe.  The stairs are a bit of a hike just to get to the entrance, especially carrying a lot of luggage and a stroller - but that was part of the description - just realize before booking.  Only minutes walk from Portobello Road and Ladbroke Grove underground, was super convenient.  We felt the place wasn't quite ready for arrival, with the greeter quickly ""straightening up"" as we were shlepping the bags up the stairs.  "

I was doing a course in central London and was able to commute door to door in about 30 min (10 min on the tube only). The neighborhood is close to many shops and plenty of good restaurants and to Hampstead Heath park which allows you to enjoy London without even going to central London. 

The flat is on the second floor of a converted Victorian house, there are therefore 4 sets of stairs to climb before arriving into the living space of the flat composed by the bathroom, one room a leaving room and the kitchen. The flat has everything that s needed for a long or short stay from all cooking utensils to an iron table, cable tv, good internet etc. The flat is very comfortable and the terrace is definitely a plus in summer. 

Andrew is really cool and was always available. He waited for us the day we arrived and gave us all the necessary instructions. At some points we lost a set of keys and Andrew was really cool and was not bothered by this. 

All in all I definitely recommend staying in this place for its reliability, it's good location and great easy going host. "

19379504,476095528,25/06/2019,132655751,Hasan,"Very poor check in and lack of any professionalism.

We travelled from 80 miles outside London with our 9 month baby. We gave estimated time of arrival,  and said it is was rush hour it might not be exact considering traffic.

We messaged on air bnb an updated  time to destination. Someone then called us  on our mobile (I suspect without bothering to check messages). And asked us how long , we advised about 10 mins to destination, plus whatever time it takes to find a parking place (for which he was not able to give any advice of where to park). I’m not convinced he was actually at the flat , as he was with a female (who he kept inferring to help him answer my question re parking - maybe at there office? Rather than at the premises where he claimed to be)

We arrived within about 10 mins to get there and another 10 mins to find parking and get to the house. We rushed as quick as we could, as he said he was waiting in the flat, and didn’t want to keep him waiting and our 9 month baby was getting unsettled after such a long journey.

Once we got outside the flat there was no one to be seen, we got confused and worried if it was a hoax or what was was going on.

We then called him and he tells us he’s left. We were disappointed having traveled so far and rush to get there as he told us he waiting ‘at the flat’ , he left to go somewhere else Without any even letting us know. So we were left just standing outside with an unsettled infant, what made it worse was he told us he’d be 10 mins, when infact kept us waiting nearly half an hour.

To top it all of when he came back he did not have the courtesy to apologise for keeping us waiting so long or even acknowledge that he should have told us he was leaving.

He also claimed he wasn’t  the person on air bnb messages app so didn’t see any of my update of arrival time messages, then later claimed he was the person using the app doing the messages to me on air bnb. It left me very confused I don’t know if he was ‘Obaydul’ or who he was, as he claimed he was and wasn’t.

I never really mind about mistakes or
mishaps, as it can happen. an apology to say sorry our mistake would have resolved the problem but it his responses disappointing to say the least.

What topped it all off, was when I mentioned it was no nice of him to leave without atleast letting us know , he claimed it was our fault that he left because we had to find parking , which meant we came exactly 10 mins after the time we said.  but I’m sure anyone reasonable would know if there is no parking at the property then that person may take a few mins to find a street to park especially in London and walk back to the property.

Definitely will not be using again, very unprofessional service."

Todo muy limpio y silencioso. Te dan total libertad para entrar y salir con tu propia llave. El desayuno en casa resulta cómodo y agradable en una cocina muy amplia, donde el gato,bastante mimoso nos acompañaba cada mañana. Tiene la parada de tranvía a medio minuto de la puerta de casa, lo que resulta muy práctico. Es un barrio modesto pero tranquilo.Contentas con la estancia."

The room is small but cozy, has windows to keep you cool, and is just off the main drag about 3 minutes away from a great local breakfast spot (cash only but Super authentic) and lunch/dinner spots.  

Teodora also has an adorable Beagle named Troy who, if given the chance, will shower you with love (while trying to eat your snacks out of your luggage).  

All in all, a great value and 5/5 stars would stay again!  Thanks Teodora!"

Su casa es un auténtico hogar, con todo lo necesario para sentirte como en tu casa. Viajamos con nuestro niño de 5 años y se quedó encantado con la habitación, tenía un montón de juguetes con los que jugar.
Está a unos 3 minutos caminado del metro por lo que es ideal para desplazarse por Londres.
Sin dudarlo repetiríamos en nuestro próximo viaje a Londres."

The room was fine except with the windows open (it was a very hot night) there was quite a bit of traffic noise at times. Didn't bother me too much but others might find it difficult.

The couch is probably best for a couple who are both short otherwise, it’s too small for more than one person. Also there is no elevator just for you to keep in mind. I would stay here again."

There were some grapes, biscuits tea and coffee provided and rhe bed was really comfortable with 4 pillows in total. 
Even though the room is facing the street, we had no problems with sleeping.
The cat is in the private room of the apartment, so unless you would like to see her, you don't. But we highly recommend petting her since her fur is really soft and fluffy."

37378012,644254352,30/07/2020,193773337,Kieley,"Our stay was a bit uncomfortable because the host never showed us around or introduced us to the long term tenants. They didn't make much space for us in the kitchen or fridge and were a bit messy, but never rude. There were problems with the showers. One of them floods every time you use it and the hot water would run out, probably due to the fact that there are 8 other long-term tenants living here. This information would have been nice to know before we booked this place. Also the rule for only using the kitchen for one hour at a time seemed not to apply to some of the other people in the house. The kitchen and common spaces were a bit dirty. The room was fine but not as bright and new looking as in the photos. The same goes for the rest of the house. I definitely wouldn't pay more than $25 a night for this place."
21139824,266582876,20/05/2018,102492099,Sheridan,A fabulous place to base yourself for any event in the city. Christie is a warm and welcoming host who made me feel like part of her family.

We stayed here with two children (3 months and 3.5 yrs) and three adults and it suited us perfectly. Hilary even left out some toys for us. The location can't be beaten, the apartment is warm, clean and lived-in - which is nice. Great bathroom. There can be some noise from the street below that makes its way up at night - but its more people than cars so not a huge concern. Overall really nice stay and we'd stay here again. "

It’s very cute, more than enough room for two people, and Karla is a great host who has supplied the place with quite a few amenities. I asked about potential connection concerns, but Karla assured me and was right about how strong the internet was, which I needed for work there. It is very easy access to central London and the apartment is clean, sizable, and 100% worth the price.You’re also right next to Westfield mall, just a quick walk away. Karla is a lovely host and she will make sure your stay is comfortable, address any concerns, and take the time to help. I would absolutely stay again given the opportunity."
